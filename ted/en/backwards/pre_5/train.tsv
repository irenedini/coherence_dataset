842#13	"We looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated, where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation in a wing of the building and pry open the windows that were no longer operable, but they made them operable for our study.
And we also sampled the outdoor air.
If you look at the x-axis of this graph, you'll see that what we commonly want to do -- which is keeping the outdoors out -- we accomplished that with mechanical ventilation."	We looked at rooms that were mechanically ventilated, which are the data points in the blue.	1
1865#257	"Some say we already share our planet with alien intelligences.
A 2011 study showed that elephants can cooperate to solve problems.

662#402	"And it's led to a view of human nature that we're rational individuals who respond in straightforward ways to incentives, and it's led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior is.
And it's produced a great amputation, a shallow view of human nature.
We're really good at talking about material things, but we're really bad at talking about emotions."	That, for centuries, we've inherited a view of human nature based on the notion that we're divided selves, that reason is separated from the emotions and that society progresses to the extent that reason can suppress the passions.	1
1114#49	"Without Iraq balancing Iran, Iran could now become a threat, some in Israel argued.
In fact, the current dynamic that you see between Iran and Israel has its roots more so in the geopolitical reconfiguration of the region after the Cold War than in the events of 1979, because at this point, Iran and Israel emerge as two of the most powerful states in the region, and rather than viewing each other as potential security partners, they increasingly came to view each other as rivals and competitors.
So Israel, who in the 1980s lobbied for and improved U.S.-Iran relations now feared a U.S.-Iran rapprochement, thinking that it would come at Israel's security interests' expense, and instead sought to put Iran in increased isolation."	The Soviet Union collapsed, Iraq was defeated, and a new environment was created in the region in which both of them felt more secure, but they were also now left unchecked.	1

Having a decent share of the national wealth for the middle class is not bad for growth.
It is actually useful both for equity and efficiency reasons."	And also, extreme inequality can be bad for our democratic institutions if it creates very unequal access to political voice, and the influence of private money in U.S. politics, I think, is a matter of concern right now.	1

This is so specific that, for example, if you look at the part that is covered in red in the upper part of the brain stem, if you damage that as a result of a stroke, for example, what you get is coma or vegetative state, which is a state, of course, in which your mind disappears, your consciousness disappears.
What happens then actually is that you lose the grounding of the self, you have no longer access to any feeling of your own existence, and, in fact, there can be images going on, being formed in the cerebral cortex, except you don't know they're there."

1648#136	"So far, most city governments have been effective at using tech to turn citizens into human sensors who serve authorities with data on the city: potholes, fallen trees or broken lamps.
They have also, to a lesser extent, invited people to participate in improving the outcome of decisions that were already made for them, just like my mom when I was eight and she told me that I had a choice: I had to be in bed by 8 p.m., but I could choose my pink pajamas or my blue pajamas.
That's not participation, and in fact, governments have not been very good at using technology to enable participation on what matters — the way we allocate our budget, the way we occupy our land, and the way we manage our natural resources."	Unfortunately for us, when it comes to fostering democratic processes, our city governments have not used technology to its full potential.	1

And while these time bombs -- none of them has a fuse beyond 50 years, and most of them have fuses of a few decades -- some of them, in some places, have much shorter fuses."

This is why both parties pay attention to these states.
However, others argue that the electoral college protects small states such as Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire, and even geographically large states with small populations like Alaska, Wyoming and the Dakotas."	Think of it this way.	1
903#37	"A forest can be an integral part of our urban existence.
A forest, for me, is a place so dense with trees that you just can't walk into it.

If you're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge in the garage, you expect a party to happen at any moment, and you need to be ready."	We don't share it with the other three apes, the gorilla, the orangutan and the gibbon, who are more typical of mammals, having sex only about a dozen times per birth.	1

So if you combine the two studies together, then the question becomes, can you start from a face and, using facial recognition, find a name and publicly available information about that name and that person, and from that publicly available information infer non-publicly available information, much more sensitive ones which you link back to the face?
And the answer is, yes, we can, and we did."	We started from social media data, we combined it statistically with data from U.S. government social security, and we ended up predicting social security numbers, which in the United States are extremely sensitive information.	1
1310#49	"When in the 19th century people were choking from the soot of the dark, satanic mills, the planners said, hey, let's move the housing away from the mills.
And lifespans increased immediately, dramatically, and we like to say the planners have been trying to repeat that experience ever since.
So there's the onset of what we call Euclidean zoning, the separation of the landscape into large areas of single use."	It's the story of planning, the story of the formation of the planning profession.	1

And now we can see inside of the brain at a resolution and ability never before available, and essentially learn how to reconstruct and maybe even reengineer or backwards engineer the brain, so we can better understand pathology, disease and therapy.	1

1174#229	"But it also makes them easier to suppress.
Too often, governments do not view protests as elementary to democracy.
Instead, they violently crush social movements or work to discredit their message."	These dynamics are what makes it easy to dismiss protests as riots or to assume they are of limited political utility.	1
366#314	"So finally, we conclude again with the most consequential question, the question that will have the gravest consequences for the rest of our lives: Are Americans and Chinese going to let the forces of history drive us to a war that would be catastrophic for both?
Or can we summon the imagination and courage to find a way to survive together, to share the leadership in the 21st century, or, as Xi Jinping , to create a new form of great power relations?
That's the issue I've been pursuing passionately for the last two years."	Each seems determined to play his assigned part and is right on script.	1
2175#16	"The good news is, we have more.
Thanks to human ingenuity, we have the technology today to remove CO2 out of the air using a chemically manufactured approach.
I like to think of this as a synthetic forest."	And although engineers and scientists are doing the invaluable work to accelerate these natural processes, it simply won't be enough.	1

463#344	"And actually the stories that we tell ourselves, we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here.
And one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories out of what people are doing.
Stories about the community that's produced its own 21 pound note, for example, the school that's turned its car park into a food garden, the community that's founded its own energy company."	Because I think stories are vital here.	1
2166#75	"And we found over 100,000 species of bacteria and fungi that live in our dust bunnies, thousands more that live on our clothes or in our showers.
We've gone further still, and we looked at the microorganisms that live inside the bodies of each of those bugs in our home.
In each bug, for example, a wasp, we see a microscopic jungle unfold in a petri plate, a world of hundreds of vibrant species."	In doing so, we found over 600 species of bugs that live in USA homes, everything from spiders and cockroaches to tiny mites that cling to feathers.	1
1769#67	"Every apartment is unique, and this individuality tells a story about each family's circumstances and values.
Many of these people take their homes and interior spaces very seriously, putting a lot of work and care into the details.

2123#301	"But this one's kind of cool.
So this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had, with a difference.

332#232	"And we know that in the future it will enable us to improve and facilitate communication.
But these studies also reveal that communication relies on a common ground.
And we have to be really worried as a society if we lose this common ground and our ability to speak with people that are slightly different than us because we let a few very strong media channels take control of the mic, and manipulate and control the way we all think."	In this, I start to reveal the hidden neural mechanism by which we communicate.	1
903#479	"That is more Big Macs than McDonald's has ever produced.

They didn't have to feel bad for me because I was nervous, they could experience that with me, and we were all one big happy, nervous, uncomfortable family.
By thinking about my audience, by embracing and exploiting my problem, I was able to take something that was blocking my progress, and turn it into something that was essential for my success."	And then accounting for things like my shaky voice, and I knew I would be singing about a half-octave higher than normal, because I was nervous.	1

If you want to pick one direction and move that way, it helps to have a front end where you can group your sensory organs-- your eyes, ears and nose.
It helps to have your mouth there too since you're more likely to run into food or enemies from this end."	In this camp, we have foxes, beetles, sharks, butterflies, and, of course, humans.	1

After every use I would wash and reuse them.

This opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me, and after playing with the software development kit a little bit, I made a couple of apps, I made some test apps."	Well, this is how I approached it, this is what I did.	1

And so overall, if we're optimistic, we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of six.
But for these first three factors now, we've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons, and that just won't cut it."	Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent.	1

Based on epidemiological data, we know that one of the causes, or one of the associations, I should say, is advanced paternal age, that is, increasing age of the father at the time of conception.
In addition, another vulnerable and critical period in terms of development is when the mother is pregnant."	In fact, there's probably not one single answer.	1
1282#476	"That's where we live.
It has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between the orbit of the Earth out through -- to the orbit of Jupiter.
The asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate, but not very large."	If you look at the solar system, as we know it today, it has a few planets close to the Sun.	1
2136#94	"In the beginning of my time there in 2000, I was very interested in communities.
But this is the kind of community I was thinking of -- a lunar community It had all of the same needs as a community on Earth would have, but it had some very unique constraints.
And we had to think about how we would provide energy for this very unique community."	Now, I spent 10 years working at NASA.	1

329#53	"So these bats remember their friends for a really long time.
With a brain the size of a peanut, they maintain individualized, long-term social bonds, We didn't know that was possible.
We knew that primates and elephants and dolphins could do that, but compared to bats, they have huge brains."	Even more interesting, in fact: Every year, around October, the colony splits up, and all bats hibernate separately, but year after year, when the bats come together again in the spring, the communities stay the same.	1
1585#37	"To me it seemed like a brilliant idea to expose the president, but to my boss --  My boss didn't think it was such a great idea.
At that time, the presidential office, Los Pinos, had issued a direct censor against the media.

I could get access to it.
In the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching, we really see the advent of the Internet."	This was different than either generation had experienced before, and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level.	1

He inflicted pain, and he treated it.
And he didn’t know it at the time, but over the next five decades, he'd draw on these dueling identities to forge a whole new way to think about pain."	He was a wrestler; he was a doctor.	1

It's called academic innovation.
And what does all of that mean?"	And so we have done -- if you look at our website at the Chemistry Discovery Center, you'll see people coming from all over the country to look at how we are redesigning courses, having an emphasis on collaboration, use of technology, using problems out of our biotech companies on our campus, and not giving students the theories, but having them struggle with those theories.	1

474#271	"But it was also pretty thrilling.
Because as soon as we gave ourselves permission to dream, those threads connecting much of our work became self-evident.
We realized, for instance, that the bottomless quest for profits that is forcing so many people to work more than 50 hours a week, without security, and that is fueling this epidemic of despair is the same quest for bottomless profits and endless growth that is at the heart of our ecological crisis and is destabilizing our planet."

982#222	"Specifically, the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution, which prohibits state governments from abusing its citizens, does not require state governments to intervene when private parties abuse its citizens.
So what does that mean in real life?
That means that when a woman calls the police from her home, afraid that an intruder may attack her, she is not entitled to the state's protection."	As it stands, the US Constitution denies fundamental protections to victims of gender violence such as sexual assault, intimate partner violence and stalking.	1

And another idea that I had as well, that was brought forward by an ecologist -- he basically did a calculation where he took one liter of gas and said, well, how much carbon it would take, and how much organic material?
It was 23 metric tons for one liter."	And then the third one is this idea of the end of oil, this entropic end, where all of our parts of cars, our tires, oil filters, helicopters, planes -- where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up?	1

And one of the women was Agnes -- there on your extreme left -- she was one of the first three women parliamentarians in Rwanda, and her legacy should have been to be one of the mothers of Rwanda.
We built this institution based on social justice, gender equity, this idea of empowering women."	And I have learned that power, particularly in its absolute form, is an equal opportunity provider.	1
1760#181	"Now, this was a crammed in section that had representations of black people in painting and black people who painted.
It was poorly curated, let's just put it that way.

1932#206	"First, liars reference themselves less, when making deceptive statements.
""They write or talk more about others, often using the third person to distance and disassociate themselves from their lie, which sounds more false: """"Absolutely no party took place at this house,"""" or """"I didn't host a party here.""""""
Second, liars tend to be more negative, because on a subconscious level, they feel guilty about lying."	A technology known as linguistic text analysis has helped to identify four such common patterns in the subconscious language of deception.	1

I ask myself why I didn't stand with you then.
One reason is that I became entranced by the gurus of change, became a worshiper of the religion of the new for novelty's sake, and of globalization and open borders and kaleidoscopic diversity."	I know that feeling hurt is often prologue to dealing hurt.	1
907#34	"They're the white, fuzzy, elliptical things here.

Well, I think one of the solutions we may have is to study some viruses that routinely jump from wild animals into people, or into our pets, or our livestock, even if they're not the same viruses that we think are going to cause pandemics.
If we can use those everyday killer viruses to work out some of the patterns of what drives that initial, crucial jump from one species to the next, and, potentially, how we might stop it, then we're going to end up better prepared for those viruses that jump between species more rarely but pose a greater threat of pandemics."	Patterns that could tell us when or where the next pandemic might strike.	1

And I think that there's theories that are beginning to understand about how it started with RNA, but I'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it, which is that, at that time, there were little drops of oil floating around with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them.	1

And it turns out that ants will respond to the right rate of contact with a glass bead with hydrocarbon extract on it, as they would to contact with real ants."	And we've done experiments that show that that's because the longer an ant stays outside, the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface change, and so they come to smell different by doing different tasks.	1

There’s also a fascinating connection to cancer here, because people with neurologic diseases have a very low incidence of most cancers."	So one approach we’re taking is to try to design drugs that function like molecular Scotch tape, to hold the protein into its proper shape.	1

Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve.

1625#81	"And I'm going to take you through the architecture of the machine — that's why it's computer architecture — and tell you about this machine, which is a computer.
So let's talk about the memory.
The memory is very like the memory of a computer today, except it was all made out of metal, stacks and stacks of cogs, 30 cogs high."	We heard those wonderful sounds of what this thing would have sounded like.	1
630#225	"""It was very hard to come and say, """"I want to do this.""""""

They're taking information from our planet at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles.
Those are seals from many countries being released who are sampling underneath the ice sheets and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality on both poles."	And then for sort of an encore from these animals, they're helping us.	1
310#37	"And it is important that we understand what during sleep actually transacts these memory benefits, because there are real medical and societal implications.
And let me just tell you about one area that we've moved this work out into, clinically, which is the context of aging and dementia.
Because it's of course no secret that, as we get older, our learning and memory abilities begin to fade and decline."	And it's the combined quality of these deep-sleep brainwaves that acts like a file-transfer mechanism at night, shifting memories from a short-term vulnerable reservoir to a more permanent long-term storage site within the brain, and therefore protecting them, making them safe.	1

2118#203	"And yet, there is this disconnect.
Well I believe that our identity is at risk.
That when we actually don't care about these difficult things, the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated."	And yet, in this country, in the states of the Old South, we execute people -- where you're 11 times more likely to get the death penalty if the victim is white than if the victim is black, 22 times more likely to get it if the defendant is black and the victim is white -- in the very states where there are buried in the ground the bodies of people who were lynched.	1
531#61	"So, we've learned in the last century that there are exotic objects in the universe -- black holes.
We've even learned that there's dark matter and dark energy that we can't see.
So you're looking now at an actual image of dark matter."	So larger the bucket, the larger the mirror we have, the more light we can see, and the farther back we can view.	1

In Afghanistan, it could have meant instead of concentrating on the big presidential and parliamentary elections, we should have done what was in the Afghan constitution from the very beginning, which is to get direct local elections going at a district level and elect people's provincial governors.
But for any of these things to work, the honesty in language, the local democracy, it's not just a question of what politicians do."	That can mean different things in different countries.	1

358#82	"Even the Lawrence Livermore National Labs have gotten into the act, designing a prototype phone that has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs.
Now, there's an enormous variety of tiny, inexpensive sensors on the market, and you can easily imagine someone putting together a phone that could measure temperature, CO2 or methane levels, the presence of some biotoxins -- potentially, in a few years, maybe even H5N1 avian flu virus.
You could see that some kind of system like this would actually be a really good fit with Larry Brilliant's InSTEDD project."	Swedish firm Uppsala Biomedical, more seriously, makes a mobile phone add-on that can process blood tests in the field, uploading the data, displaying the results.	1

1682#133	"So in the sector where you have lots of different actors -- public, private, of course, but also third-sector organizations -- creating value, the way we actually measure value in this sector is through the price system itself.
Prices reveal value.
""So when, recently, the price of an antibiotic went up by 400 percent overnight, and the CEO was asked, """"How can you do this?"""

So what can we do?"	And even in rich countries, many patients are not getting the best medicine.	1
1713#273	"The natural thing to do is to postulate consciousness itself as something fundamental, a fundamental building block of nature.
This doesn't mean you suddenly can't do science with it.
This opens up the way for you to do science with it."	If you can't explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundamentals — space, time, mass, charge — then as a matter of logic, you need to expand the list.	1
207#744	"So, it's the first time we have a robust opportunity to really explore the futures of ability of attaining the SDGs within PBs.
Now, how do we do this?
Well, look at this."	And we were able to find patterns and really convergent trends that gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to now project economic development, resources use from water, food and energy, population growth, income per person, yet along these consistent and systemic pathways.	1
549#314	"Well how do you fix it?
We could spend 10,000 lifetimes trying to prune this legal jungle.

Is there a way we could have the benefits of high-fidelity monitoring that we get with our trusted partners in the hospital while someone is at home living their daily life?"	So Jane basically has one of two options: stay at the hospital on bed rest, a prisoner to the technology until she gives birth, and then spend the rest of her life paying for the bill; or head home after her 10-day stay and hope for the best.	1

723#324	"But actually, it's a drive.
It comes from the motor of the mind, the wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind.

The societal one is a lot more challenging.
I don't know what the playbook is for getting Bill to engage and stay engaged throughout life."	And if you find yourself worried that something like a guaranteed income is going to stifle our drive to succeed and make us kind of complacent, you might be interested to know that social mobility, one of the things we really pride ourselves on in the United States, is now lower than it is in the northern European countries that have these very generous social safety nets.	1

First, we need to be asking about workers' rights.
How do existing policies make it harder for immigrants to defend themselves and easier for them to be exploited, driving down wages, rights and protections for everyone?"	With this new map in mind, we can turn to a set of tough, new, urgently needed questions, radically different from the ones we've asked before -- questions that might change the borders of the immigration debate.	1

2199#121	"Now I can proudly say --  I can proudly say, as a public transport map, this diagram is an utter failure.
Except, probably, in one aspect: I now had a great visual representation of just how clogged up and overrun the city center really was.
Now, call me old-fashioned, but I think a public transport route map should have lines, because that's what they are, yeah?"	I'll zoom in again so that you get the full impact of the quays and Westmoreland Street.	1
155#106	"The small idea is, let's all of us engage more with this in the way that Jason has illustrated.
Why can't we have these kinds of conversations with our own elders and people who might be approaching this?
There are a couple of things you can do."	And this is the small idea.	1
709#19	"So if a country gets downgraded by a rating agency, the country has to pay more in order to borrow money on the international markets.
So it affects you as a citizen and as a taxpayer, because you and your fellow countrymen have to pony up more in order to borrow.
But what if a country can't afford to pay more because it's maybe too expensive?"	If a rating agency rates a country, it basically assesses and evaluates a country's debt and the ability and willingness of a country to repay its debt.	1
2069#23	"Some of you may have used it before.
It's kind of on its way out now, but we still use it for 99 percent of our stuff.

780#72	"So I'm going to play you a couple of those.
I want you to tell me if you think this laughter is real laughter, or if you think it's posed.
So is this involuntary laughter or more voluntary laughter?"	So imagine your friend told a joke, and you're laughing because you like your friend, but not really because the joke's all that.	1
808#16	"Because in the mid-1950s, when I was a tiny child, they had the audacity to launch a very primitive little satellite called Sputnik, which sent the Western world into a hysterical tailspin.
And a tremendous amount of money went into the funding of science and mathematics skills for kids.
And I'm a product of that generation, like so many other of my peers."	And then of course, I blame the Soviet Union.	1
1218#40	"I was almost put on a special needs track as a child.
A month into kindergarten, my teacher wrote a page-long memo noting that I was impulsive, had a short attention span, and despite my wonderful curiosity, I was exhausting to work with.
The principal asked my parents into a meeting, asked my mother if there had been complications at birth and suggested I meet with a school psychologist."	I've heard about recruiters who are quick to label a candidate a job-hopper based on a single short stint on their resume; read about professors who are more likely to ignore identical messages from students because their name was black or Asian instead of white.	1
1168#66	"Well, I'm an American, so I certainly don't hate myself, sometimes.
I'm an oppressed woman.
I'm way too stubborn for that."	Others may assume that I'm a terrorist - I'm not - that I hate Americans.	1
1336#97	"And I know there are good people out there.
I saw thousands of you in the streets, protesting family separation.
And that largely helped bring about an end to the official policy."	And the thing that makes me so desperate is that all of you are facing the same choice, but you don't understand it yet.	1
1897#74	"Video: You're happy.
You're very happy about this part.
You've got to put some water on the fire."	These are happy vocalizations.	1
2009#52	"And so we were able to do this by embedding 40 small, tiny linear actuators inside the device, and that allow you not only to touch them but also back-drive them as well.
But we've also looked at other ways to create more complex shape change.

549#338	"It turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure.
And it is this: Law sets boundaries, and on one side of those boundaries are all the things you can't do or must do -- you can't steal, you've got to pay your taxes -- but those same boundaries are supposed to define and protect a dry ground of freedom.
""Isaiah Berlin put it this way: """"Law sets frontiers, not artificially drawn, within which men shall be inviolable."""""""	So, what's needed is not just to limit claims, but actually create a dry ground of freedom.	1
1070#202	"So figuring out all these relationships with relative and absolute location, distance, timing, velocities -- that's really the key to the science of moving dots, or as we like to call it, spatiotemporal pattern recognition, in academic vernacular.
Because the first thing is, you have to make it sound hard -- because it is.
The key thing is, for NBA coaches, it's not that they want to know whether a pick-and-roll happened or not."	What are the key features that let a computer navigate the world of moving dots?	1
862#60	"The 14 girls decided to end their suffering by drinking the poison.
Before the poison took full effect, they were discovered by ISIS and taken to the hospital, where they survived.
ISIS decided to separate the girls and sell them individually."	Ayda had been told by one of the girls that she noticed rat poison in the bathroom.	1
1206#356	"And you can see certain biases that come up again and again.
I'll give you four.
We tend to exaggerate spectacular and rare risks and downplay common risks -- so, flying versus driving."	A lot of good experiments in this.	1
902#258	"All of us, you know?
If you remember back in US history, African-Americans were told they couldn’t join the military, and now they serve.
Women as well were banned, but now they've been allowed."	However, I need your help and support to lobby.	1
1832#115	"But you don't use it for inventory and payroll; DEC is now twice bankrupt.
You don't need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it.

1316#280	"As the country got more well-off, unemployment actually rose and people's satisfaction with things like housing and education plummeted.
But it wasn't just anger at economic injustice.
It was also people's deep longing for freedom."	But it was exactly the opposite in Egypt.	1
1707#195	"They set people off.
They're incendiary and they do not allow us to find common ground.
They do not allow us to find a common heart."	All of those words.	1
1525#19	"But if you zoom in, in the very center of Brasilia, just where the point is there, you see it's littered with desire paths.
They're absolutely everywhere.
Now, they thought that they had future-proofed this design."	Slightly worryingly, he put most of the important government buildings in the cockpit.	1
1392#438	"Isolation, which is tied to depression, is another memory thief.
A study by the Harvard School of Public Health found that older people with high levels of social integration had a slower rate of memory decline over a six-year period.
The exact reason remains unclear, but experts suspect that social interaction gives our brain a mental workout."	Dwelling on sad events in the past, another symptom of depression, makes it difficult to pay attention to the present, affecting the ability to store short-term memories.	1
1773#106	"And so, as a child, I saw jam disappear from the breakfast table, then margarine disappeared, then bread became too expensive, then milk became rationed.
And most of all, a kind of normalized political fear invaded our lives.
All of these stories make me who I am."	I grew up under repressive military governments that devalued education, so that sometimes, my parents were not paid their salaries.	1
1977#437	"A great editor saves a writer from her excesses.
Copy editors, too, have a code; we don't advertise our oversights.
I feel disloyal divulging them here, so let's have look at what we do right."	The editor never sells out the writer, never goes public about bad jokes that had to be cut or stories that went on too long.	1
46#275	"Perhaps it's no surprise that in a 2007 Pew survey, when surveyed, Africans in 10 countries said they thought that the Chinese were doing amazing things to improve their livelihoods by wide margins, by as much as 98 percent.
Finally, China is also providing innovative solutions to age-old social problems that the world faces.
If you travel to Mogadishu, Mexico City or Mumbai, you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics continue to be a stumbling block to the delivery of medicine and healthcare in the rural areas."	Now this is something that people can see and point to.	1
1527#113	"Because what it pays attention to is what it's seeing and interacting with, and what you're understanding what it's doing.
So in the videos I'm about to show you, you're going to see a visual attention system on a robot which has -- it looks for skin tone in HSV space, so it works across all human colorings.
It looks for highly saturated colors, from toys."	The most important thing for building a robot that you can interact with socially is its visual attention system.	1

And actually that's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery and this kind of surgery.
""Because you might say, """"Well, this type of surgery might be regarded as cosmetic."""""""	They don't feel different.	1
1217#89	"I suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist.
It is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version of how to make another copy of you.

509#169	"We started in 2004.
You might have noticed, we haven't done all that well so far.
Nor do I think we are by ourselves, actually going to solve the problem."	Our mission was to fix the world's media.	1
495#52	"I wouldn't have qualified as transgender.
If my family, though, had been the kind of people to believe in therapy, they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty.
But in my particular case, I just woke up one day when I was 14, and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again."	I felt like I was performing this elaborate act.	1
201#188	"And at the same time, we're growing more animals, and those animals are contributing food to humans as well.
So what we see is that that animal-human interface is becoming closer and closer together.
And this intensive agriculture of animals and this intensive increase in human populations living together on the same planet is really a melting pot where outbreaks can occur and do occur."	In fact, we're an urban world, where people live in urban areas.	1
972#85	"And the Volvo is doing quite fine.
This is the war.
The Toyota got off track, and now the Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden -- can you see that?"	The Toyota has a very bad start down here, you can see, and the United States Ford is going off-road there.	1
1630#182	"So very simple robots, but they could be programmed to exhibit collective intelligence, and that's what we were able to do.
So this is what a single robot looks like.
It's quite small, about the size of a quarter, and you can program how it moves, but it can also wirelessly communicate with other robots, and it can measure distances from them."	One of our first robotic quests along this line was to create our very own colony of a thousand robots.	1
1736#164	"You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade.
The next minute they're on the same side.
Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he's resented."	It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry, not emotion.	1
425#28	"These are sketches of some of the little details.
Rome is a city full of surprises.
I mean, we're talking about unusual perspectives, we're talking about narrow little winding streets that suddenly open into vast, sun-drenched piazzas -- never, though, piazzas that are not humanly scaled."	Part of the reason I'm showing you these is that it sort of helps illustrate this process I go through of trying to figure out what it is I feel about Rome and why I feel it.	1
457#190	"So people like to share, if you give them the opportunity and the choice.
And the reason that I got obsessed with this, besides the obvious family aspects, is that I spend a lot of time around mathematicians, and mathematicians are drawn to places where there's a lot of data because they can use it to tease signals out of noise.
And those correlations that they can tease out, they're not necessarily causal agents, but math, in this day and age, is like a giant set of power tools that we're leaving on the floor, not plugged in in health, while we use hand saws."	But only five percent of the people wanted out.	1
1180#124	"Every one of them becomes a louder and louder voice, but they don't represent us.
They don't represent what our views are.
And that gets me back to the dollar, and it gets me back to reminding myself that we know this experience."	And they've captured the process through familiar ways, through a primary system which encourages that small group of people's voices, because that small group of people, the people who answer all yeses or all noes on those ideological questions, they might be small but every one of them has a blog, every one of them has been on Fox or MSNBC in the last week.	1
328#220	"But they don't go far enough, because they make people jump through hoops.
They have to come on the right days, at the right times.
They might have to have extra food to share."	So, these are great baby steps.	1
1872#16	"We have to end this.
And speaking out against the policies and the politics that divide us and diminish our collective power as a global community of women, and the men and the allies who stand with us.
Becoming dangerous also means embracing whatever risks are necessary to create a world where women and girls are safe in their homes and at work, where all voices are represented and respected, all votes counted, the planet protected."	We need to be in those rooms, showing up for one another, challenging the cultural construct that encourages us, especially women and girls, to compete, compare, criticize.	1
2#94	"This universal hacker movement needs no introduction today, but six years ago they were not much more than an Internet subculture dedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats and Internet trolling campaigns.
Their moment of transformation was in early 2008 when the Church of Scientology attempted to remove certain leaked videos from appearing on certain websites.
This is when Anonymous was forged out of the seemingly random collection of Internet dwellers."	I find it astounding that someone from the shadowy corners of cyberspace can become its voice of opposition, its last line of defense even, perhaps someone like Anonymous, the leading brand of global hacktivism.	1
1848#70	"We're now beginning to take thousands of features that people like you have found and we're sharing them with archaeologists who work in Peru.

So what Sudhir eventually realized as he hung out with them more, is that, really, they didn't own those cars -- they just leased them, because they couldn't afford to own the fancy cars.
And they didn't really have gold jewelry, they had gold-plated jewelry."	The other thing the gang was very good at was marketing and trickery.	1

But I think when it comes to love, we are too willing to accept the short version of the story.
""The version of the story that asks, """"Are you still together?"""""""	There might be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk involved, and this is a very appealing story, because falling in love feels amazing, but it's also terrifying.	1
1167#25	"Plain English is about changing the content.
And one of the things I'm most proud of is this agreement for IBM.

So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group, say the use of fire, or a particular type of tool, instead of dying out, this spread rapidly, horizontally across the population, or was transmitted vertically, down the generations.
So, this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian, instead of Darwinian."	Even though the human brain had achieved its present size almost three or four hundred thousand years ago, 100,000 years ago all of this happened very, very quickly.	1

And these tensions have deep evolutionary roots, so selfish behavior is adaptive in certain circumstances -- fight or flight.

OK, so if I make a 100-nanometer cancer detector, I inject it in the bloodstream, it can leak into the tumor where it's activated by tumor enzymes to release a small signal that is small enough to be filtered out of the kidney and put into the urine, I have a signal in the outside world that I can detect.
OK, but there's one more problem."	It turns out that what the kidney filters is also dependent on size.	1

And while those numbers and those statistics are really fun to talk about and they're interesting, to me, Kiva's really about stories.

And today, less than five years in, Kiva's facilitated more than 150 million dollars, in little 25-dollar bits, from lenders and entrepreneurs -- more than a million of those, collectively in 200 countries.	1

Different ant species must use different algorithms, because they've evolved to deal with different resources, and it could be really useful to know about this, and so we recently asked ants to solve the collective search problem in the extreme environment of microgravity in the International Space Station.
When I first saw this picture, I thought, Oh no, they've mounted the habitat vertically, but then I realized that, of course, it doesn't matter."	And what they do is, when there are many ants in a small space, then each one can search very thoroughly because there will be another ant nearby searching over there, but when there are a few ants in a large space, then they need to stretch out their paths to cover more ground.	1

In a sample of 100 that would be less than a .0025% chance, and for a sample of 1000, the odds are less than 6 x 10^-36.
Similarly, with fewer participants, each individual’s outcome has a larger impact on the overall results— and can therefore skew big-picture trends."	That’s because the fewer participants are in a random sample, the less likely it is that the sample will closely represent the target population as a whole.	1

970#97	"A recent study looking at penalty shootouts in football showed that players who represent countries with a very bad record in penalty shootouts, like, for example, England, tend to be quicker to take their shots than countries with a better record, and presumably as a result, they're more likely to miss.
Which raises the question of if there's any way we could improve people's performance.
And one thing you might think about doing is punishing people for their misses and seeing if that improves them."	An exception to this, however, is penalty shootouts.	1
847#309	"Their message is the same: civic love, civic spirit, civic responsibility.

So June 2015, the LHC is switched back on.
My colleagues and I held our breath and bit our fingernails, and then finally we saw the first proton collisions at this highest energy ever."	Many of my colleagues had been working their entire careers for this moment, and frankly, to little curious me, this was the moment I'd been waiting for my entire life.	1

A responsible filmmaker should never devalue their work to a point at which it becomes less than true to the world they themselves wish to inhabit.

Now, I don't know if this theory is right, but it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now in the science of consciousness, and it's been used to integrate a whole range of scientific data, and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough you can write it on the front of a t-shirt.	1

2004#61	"If dark energy were anywhere near this strong, then the universe would have been torn apart, stars and galaxies could not form, and we would not be here.
So this is the second of those dangerous numbers, the strength of dark energy, and explaining it requires an even more fantastic level of fine-tuning than we saw for the Higgs field.
But unlike the Higgs field, this number has no known explanation."	In fact, it's been called the worst prediction in physics, and this is more than just a theoretical curiosity.	1

231#218	"Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers, nothing you can do about it.
But, it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis, and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors.
This has also gone through clinical trials, helping lots and lots of patients."	Now, this technique has been tried on dozens of patients by other groups in Helsinki, so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain, and indeed, people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation.	1
832#163	"Today, young people are often introduced to prescription opioid drugs in those ways but move on to heroin or illicit synthetic opioids that are cheaper and easier to come by.
Beyond tighter regulation of opioid painkillers, what can we do to reverse the growing rates of addiction and overdose?
A drug called naloxone is currently our best defense against overdose."	Many of the early cases of addiction were middle-aged people who became addicted to painkillers they had been prescribed, or received from friends and family members with prescriptions.	1

And all the sediment is then put through these screens, and where we go again through it very carefully, looking for small bone fragments, and it's then washed.
And these things are so exciting."	And we can bring all this information into big GIS packages, today.	1
2201#46	"And by stitching together my small act with the thousands of other small acts of participation that we're enabling through civic hacking, we think we can reenergize citizenship and restore trust in government.

1918#22	"Some thought he wasn’t critical enough of the Vietnam War, or that he was too eager to collaborate with the political establishment including the president and congress.
Others were uncomfortable with his former communist affiliation.
But ultimately, both his belief in collaboration with the government and his membership to the communist party had been driven by his desire to maximize tangible gains in liberties for black Americans, and to do so as quickly as possible."	In spite of his decades of service, Rustin’s positions on certain political issues were unpopular among his peers.	1

Then when I moved  Miami, I noticed HIV included women and children, primarily, poor black and brown people.

And in order to have that continuing education, we need to anchor it to cutting-edge research in both the life sciences and the social sciences, because we need to recognize that too often historical traumas and implicit biases sit in the space between a new mother and her clinician.	1
2188#277	"Now, this is a real hospital, in a real emergency room.
One of the reasons he chose to take this rather large video camera with him was because he didn’t want the doctors and nurses thinking he was actually sick, and sticking something into him that he was going to regret later.

89#73	"It turns out that driving, with its associated design implementation and regulatory hurdles, is actually a harder problem to solve than flying.
For those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground, this may be counter-intuitive, but driving has potholes, cobblestones, pedestrians, other drivers and a rather long and detailed list of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with.
Fortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention, and a lot of the design work that we're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continuously-variable transmission and liquid-based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop-and-go traffic, to a custom-designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground, to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment, to crash safety features."	And at 110 lbs., that's very important for solving the other side of the equation -- driving.	1
87#476	"Now sometimes, we break the world up into us versus them, into in-group versus out-group, and sometimes when we do this, we know we're doing something wrong, and we're kind of ashamed of it.

439#16	"Eratosthenes was the third librarian at the great Library of Alexandria, and he made many contributions to science.
But the one he is most remembered for began in a letter that he received as the librarian, from the town of Swenet, which was south of Alexandria.
The letter included this fact that stuck in Eratosthenes' mind, and the fact was that the writer said, at noon on the solstice, when he looked down this deep well, he could see his reflection at the bottom, and he could also see that his head was blocking the sun."	And play he did.	1

And when the cops show up, they're more likely to resist intervention, oftentimes because they haven't actually done anything illegal, they're literally just living outside.
The problem wasn't a need to train officers differently in Minneapolis."	Well, it turns out homeless folks often need services.	1
164#285	"What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre, the farmers could buy a second and a third and a fourth.
As of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization, has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average, but this didn't happen overnight.
In fact, when you go back to the beginning, there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day, that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture."	And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls infinitely expandable.	1

That's what we do for most problems -- in math, in physics, even in social policy -- we slice them into smaller, more manageable problems.
But every once in a while, as Dwight Eisenhower said, the way you solve a problem is to make it bigger."	When our son Lincoln was working on that math problem two weeks ago, it was a big, gnarly problem.	1
1881#160	"For hours afterwards, the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around -- all of this was from the houses in the slum.
When the waters subsided, it was as if it had never existed.

164#279	"And he used three fundamental principles.
The first one was miniaturization.
The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre, even if he had two, because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake."	And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation and he would redesign it from the perspective of the poor farmers themselves, because he spent so many years listening to what they needed not what he thought that they should have.	1

And I think it's pretty likely that the invasive species, the ones that come into our buildings, are going to be really good at this, because they're in your kitchen because they're really good at finding food and water.
So the most familiar resource for ants is a picnic, and this is a clustered resource."	It can be done with cheap materials.	1

Nanahuatl, Lord Sun, shined for four days straight without moving through the sky like all the previous suns had moved.
Back in their home, Teotihuacan, the gods began to worry."	But since he had shown far less bravery and much more pride, one of the gods picked up a rabbit and tossed it in his face, dimming his light.	1

I can imagine some pretty frickin' dystopian scenarios where things like internet quizzes, dating apps, horoscopes, bots, all combine to drag you down deeper and deeper rabbit holes into bad relationships and worse politics.

It's hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience, it's hard to see the pattern of this."	Now we're going to fly through it at warp a million.	1
1050#161	"Now, this is an area -- I mean, there is a treasure trove of wealth in the traditional medicine area.
This is where we need to mobilize Africans, in the Diaspora especially, to invest in this.

Somehow, the family survives for 16 months, and then, by extraordinary luck, and the passionate heart of a young American man, Sasha Chanoff, who manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane, Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix, Arizona, where they're now living and thriving."	She cuts the umbilical cord with a stick, and ties it with her own hair.	1
1984#60	"How is that?
Well, if I hold conservative values, for instance, I probably prefer big proper cars and small government over tiny, tiny cars and huge government.
And if climate science comes and then says government should expand further, then I probably will trust that science less."	Particularly in rich Western democracies, they are then less likely to believe that science.	1

And guess what?"	Perhaps most exciting to me is an idea that Bill Gates, Howard Buffett and others have supported boldly, which is to ask the question: What if, instead of looking at the hungry as victims -- and most of them are small farmers who cannot raise enough food or sell food to even support their own families -- what if we view them as the solution, as the value chain to fight hunger?	1

Just as an example, beyond Earth, only a few hundred different chemical substances have been detected.
Presumably, there are some more in lifeless locations, but on Earth, evolution created billions of different chemicals."

And I think however you feel about the use of advertising to kind of support stuff, the sight of grown men in diapers rolling around in the sand in the hope that an algorithm that they don't really understand will give them money for it suggests that this probably isn't the thing that we should be basing our society and culture upon, and the way in which we should be funding it.

And our translation of that, using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years, is to say, what if that, instead of being just a pipe, what if it is a lifeline?	1

First, unlike their math textbooks, these comics lectures taught visually.
Our students grow up in a visual culture, so they're used to taking in information that way."	This surprised me, because my students are part of a generation that was raised on screens, so I thought for sure they would like learning from a screen better than learning from a page.	1

And a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits of having lots of people look at problems, share the information and work on those things together.
So, a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time, and unless Lisa Randall changes that, we'll continue to move in linear time."	I guess I'm just going to casually tell you the types of things that I think about with this.	1

The worst possibility is that a very simple germ, like staph, for which we have one antibiotic that still works, mutates.	1

However, not only are people interested in doing this, but the citizen scientists that work with Planet Hunters have actually found planets in the data that would have gone undiscovered otherwise.	1

No sequoia on record has been able to grow taller than 130 meters – and many researchers say these trees won’t beat that cap even if they live for thousands of years to come.

2179#296	"This is Journalism 101, how we're trained in journalism schools to work in defense of truth.
Why are even long-trusted news organizations that know how to gather the facts vulnerable to attacks on their credibility?
Journalism tends to be vulnerable because of the enormous power of credible information."	It is exhausting, but after this Sherlock Holmes-ing, you usually get the facts that people need to know to make up their own minds.	1

But instead of looking at the scenery around him, seeing the beautiful vistas and noticing the cool ocean breezes, he was driving fast and contemplating driving off that bridge.
And he would later tell me that it took all of everything he had not to do so."	And the scene that I'm going to share with you, as you can see, is not about his time in the battlefield.	1
1868#216	"There's nothing dangerous about black people or any other racial group.
And so when we see these racial disparities all around us, we see them as abnormal, and then we start to figure out, OK, what policies are behind so many black people being killed by police?
What policies are behind so many Latinx people being disproportionately infected with COVID?"	And so to be anti-racist is to believe that there's nothing wrong or inferior about black people or any other racial group.	1
708#154	"They will fall into black holes.
We will live in a universe with nothing in it but black holes.

839#225	"Companies in the West spend billions of dollars investing in R&amp;D, and use tons of natural resources to create ever more complex products, to differentiate their brands from competition, and they charge customers more money for new features.
So the conventional business model in the West is more for more.
But sadly, this more for more model is running out of gas, for three reasons: First, a big portion of customers in the West because of the diminishing purchasing power, can no longer afford these expensive products."	Think of the iPhone 5, 6, then 7, 8.	1

We've been making music for tens of thousands of years, right?
And if you think about what music is -- notes and chords and keys and harmonies and melodies -- these things are algorithms."	But there is an art form that's been around for a very long time that's really about using information, abstract information, to make emotionally resonant pieces.	1
293#232	"Me and my homie Les, we grew up on the same block in the Bronx, two street dudes.

1603#43	"It's not because their DNA has degenerated.
It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power, because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere, which is separate.

We know that 30 million obese Americans in the United States don't have insulin resistance.

In the meantime, I was chairing donor meetings, for instance, in which the various donors, and many of them like to be in Nairobi -- it is true, it is one of the unsafest cities of the world, but they like to be there because the other cities are even less comfortable.
And in these donor meetings, I noticed that many of the worst projects -- which were put forward by our clients, by the governments, by promoters, many of them representing suppliers from the North -- that the worst projects were realized first."	You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries.	1

1274#1194	"It takes very little imagination to picture a world of global unrest, riots and further malnutrition.
People are hungry, and we are running dangerously low on natural resources.
For so, so many reasons, we need to change our global food production systems."	The World Health Organization recently reported that 800 million people are suffering from malnutrition and food shortage, which is due to that same growing, global population and the declining access to resources like water, energy and land.	1
1220#35	"But we believe we can do this chip manufacturing in a totally different and much more cost-effective way using molecular engineering and mimicking nature down at the nanoscale dimensions of our transistors.
As I said, the conventional manufacturing takes every tiny feature of the circuit and projects it onto the silicon.

It's strange, but in many ways I look at where I was a year ago, and I look at where I am now, and I realize that I have a lot of things I didn't have then.
I wouldn't be sitting here right now if this hadn't happened."	And in fact, it was the stories that I've documented that inspired me to get through the last year, to survive, to get back up on my new legs and to be able to come and tell their stories, but also my own story.	1

1519#48	"I'd like to end with a quote by John Keats, the Romantic English poet, a very famous quote that I'm sure all of you know.
Keats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry, but he died when he was a year older than me.
""And Keats said, """"Beauty is truth, and truth beauty."""	And the spark of that beauty, the spark of that humanity transforms into hope, and we know, whether we choose the path of music or of medicine, that's the very first thing we must instill within our communities, within our audiences, if we want to inspire healing from within.	1

But if you're a repressive government searching for political enemies, you might instead remove them, eliminate them, disrupt their social group, and those who remain behind lose social cohesion and organization.	1

This man, Hugh Thompson, this is the man who stopped the My Lai Massacre."	A brigade of American soldiers went into an undefended village full of civilians and killed between 350 and 500 of them, mass-raped women and children, mutilated bodies.	1
80#55	"But this is what it looks like from the third stage of the rocket looking at the unmanned glider as it heads into the atmosphere back towards Earth.
We've flown twice.
In the first flight, no aerodynamic control of the vehicle."	Now to conceal the shape, we changed the aspect ratio a little bit.	1
2071#217	"The move destroyed the reservations, making it easier to further subdivide and to sell with every passing generation.
Most of the surplus land and many of the plots within reservation boundaries are now in the hands of white ranchers.
Once again, the fat of the land goes to wasichu."	The American dream of individual land ownership turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reservation until nothing was left.	1
306#283	"This was a high school where I had committed acts of violence against students, against faculty; where I had protested out in front of the school for equal rights for whites and even had a sit-in in the cafeteria to try and demand a white student union.
And of course, as karma would have it, within the first couple of hours, who walks right by me but Mr. Johnny Holmes, the tough black security guard I had gotten in a fistfight with, that got me kicked out the second time and led out in handcuffs from the school.
He didn't recognize me, but I saw him, and I didn't know what to do."	And then I became terrified to learn that they'd actually be putting me back at my old high school, the same one I got kicked out of twice, to install their computers.	1
1468#46	"More important is motivation and determination.
It was crucial that the students see that we're working hard for them and they're all supporting each other.
Now, the class ran 10 weeks, and in the end, about half of the 160,000 students watched at least one video each week, and over 20,000 finished all the homework, putting in 50 to 100 hours."	And finally, from Teach For America, I learned that a class is not primarily about information.	1
218#122	"At the end, there will only be one marker left standing and it will determine our wealth in retirement.
Yes, this person retired at 150 percent of their working income in retirement.
They're making more money while retired than they were making while they were working."	It simulates what it is like to invest in something and to watch that investment pan out.	1
208#113	"I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s turn the desert that you see on the right there back to grassland, and thankfully, now their grandchildren are on the land with hope for the future.
And look at the amazing change in this one, where that gully has completely healed using nothing but livestock mimicking nature, and once more, we have the third generation of that family on that land with their flag still flying.
The vast grasslands of Patagonia are turning to desert as you see here."	This land in Mexico was in terrible condition, and I've had to mark the hill because the change is so profound.	1
2079#616	"The second idea is self-pacing.
Now, when I went to a lecture hall, and if you were like me, by the fifth minute I would lose the professor.

""It's like, """"Do you want to get your luggage stolen at the airport?""""""
Probably not, but I've never been asked, right?"	I posited that micromanagement is just bringing in great, wonderful, imaginative people and then crushing their souls, so is it that we actually want to hire -- deep down inside of us -- dull and unimaginative people?	1
787#51	"But it turns out that cell fates are a lot more plastic than we might have imagined.
About 13 years ago, some scientists showed something truly revolutionary.
By inserting just a handful of genes into an adult cell, like one of your skin cells, you can transform that cell back to the naïve state."	They have set off down the different paths that form all the structures and organs of your adult body.	1

So Loki promised to take care of the situation, and dashed away.
Outside, night had fallen, and the builder prepared to set off to retrieve the final load of stones."	Suddenly, Loki didn’t feel so clever.	1
2091#137	"It's what propels societies forward.
In that same slum in Nairobi, I met a young businesswoman, and she was making backpacks out of her home.
She and her young kids would go to the local jeans factory and collect scraps of denim."	But here's the thing -- our desire to bring every good thing to our children is a force for good throughout the world.	1
1973#199	"Since the poles aren’t always aligned with the rotational axis of the star, the beams spin like lighthouse beacons, which appear to blink when viewed from Earth.
We call those pulsars.
The detection of one of these tantalizing flashing signals by astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell in 1967 was in fact the way we indirectly discovered neutron stars in the first place."	This magnetic concentration forms vortexes that radiate beams from the magnetic poles.	1
367#85	"They're asking you and me, using online policy wikis, to help not simply get rid of burdensome regulations that impede entrepreneurship, but to replace those regulations with more innovative alternatives, sometimes using transparency in the creation of new iPhone apps that will allows us both to protect consumers and the public and to encourage economic development.
That is a nice sideline of open government.
It's not only the benefits that we've talked about with regard to development."	So what is Texas doing?	1
1349#22	"We can do it without harming any tissue.
So this is, I think, the first kosher Hippocratic surgical system.
Okay, so let's talk a little bit about ultrasound, the force of ultrasound."	We need to reach a target inside the brain.	1
1650#140	"It was the compassion and empathy from my family, friends, professionals and sometimes even strangers that saved me.
Even empathy from one person can make a difference.
The theory of minority influence, proposed by social psychologist Serge Moscovici, says that even in small numbers, when there's consistency over time, change can happen."	I've seen some very dark days in my life.	1
711#61	"And I found that there were ways to duplicate the same approach that I used to use on the airplane.
Only this time, instead of the product being shaped by the wind, it was shaped by the human body.
So the discipline was -- as in the airplane you learn a lot about how to deal with the air, for a chair you have to learn a lot about how to deal with the body, and what the body needs, wants, indicates it needs."	So I started doing that.	1
949#13	"And we see how this system lets him walk up to any surface and start using his hands to interact with the information that is projected in front of him.

1625#42	"But why does this conflicting information make us feel so terrible?
Scientists aren't sure, but they think there's an evolutionary explanation.
Fast moving vehicles and video recordings have only existed in the last couple of centuries, a blink in evolutionary time."	This time, your eyes think you're moving while your ear knows you're sitting still.	1
1335#571	"Also, for all the shoreline that has booms -- hundreds and hundreds of miles of shoreline -- all of the shoreline that has booms, there's adjacent shoreline that doesn't have any booms.
There is ample opportunity for oil and dirty water to get in behind them.

1543#19	"Deadly viruses are appearing in places where we can't really expect them, and as a global health community, we're caught on our heels.
We're constantly chasing after the next viral emergency in this perpetual cycle, always trying to extinguish epidemics after they've already started.
So with new diseases appearing every year, now is really the time that we need to start thinking about what we can do about it."	So there's a disturbing trend here, right?	1
1113#52	"And a few meters ahead of us, there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank, and its branches were touching the water, and it was shadowy.
""And if had been a horror movie, people in the audience would have started saying, """"Don't go in there.""

Resolving this Terminator myth shows us that there are two forces at play: one, machine substitution that harms workers, but also these complementarities that do the opposite.
Now the second myth, what I call the intelligence myth."	And once again, people displaced from tasks in the old bit of pie could tumble into tasks in the new bit of pie instead.	1
1952#212	"There was another condition.
This other condition was inspired by David, my student.
And this other condition we called the Sisyphic condition."	And we told them that at the end of the experiment, we will take all these Bionicles, we will disassemble them, we will put them back in the boxes, and we will use it for the next participant.	1

In 2003, my brother from another mother and father Dean Obeidallah and I started the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival, now in its 10th year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of Arab-Americans in media, while also reminding casting directors that South Asian and Arab are not synonymous."	Some people say I'm the first stand-up comic in the Arab world.	1

1361#151	"This is not just for poor people -- everybody will have these Health Impact Fund registered medicines at cost, at a very low price.
One very important hurdle here, politically, is that we have to make sure that we have long-term visibility for innovators, that innovators know that the money is actually there, and so we need governments to fund the Health Impact Fund, because only governments can make predictable commitments for a long period of time.
Because the Health Impact Fund registration is voluntary, you basically have a self-adjusting reward rate."	You pay with one hand through the tax system, but you get something back with the other hand, because you also get these medicines for cheap.	1

And that makes a huge difference.
When India was growing at about three, 3.5 percent and the population was growing at two percent, its per capita income was doubling every 45 years."	You know if you look at the development in the West over 200 years, the average growth may have been about two percent.	1

This mistaken belief protects us from the conflict between our values and our behavior.

So as a science fiction writer whose stories often take place years or even centuries from now, I've found that people are really hungry for visions of the future that are both colorful and lived in, but I found that research on its own is not enough to get me there.

And that's where texting comes in.
And so, texting is very loose in its structure."	On a manual typewriter it was very difficult, and even when we had electric typewriters, or then computer keyboards, the fact is that even if you can type easily enough to keep up with the pace of speech, more or less, you have to have somebody who can receive your message quickly.	1

480#16	"Some of those come from the communal experience of being on a team, for instance, learning to trust and depend on others, to accept help, to give help, and to work together towards a common goal.
In addition, commitment to a team and doing something fun can also make it easier to establish a regular habit of exercise.
School sport participation has also been shown to reduce the risk of suffering from depression for up to four years."	Some of the most significant are psychological benefits, both in the short and long term.	1

We have the Free Speech representation on one side, and we have the FreeSpeech Engine, which generates English."	That's a provocative idea.	1
2160#13	"The real difference between humans and all other animals is not on the individual level; it's on the collective level.
Humans control the planet because they are the only animals that can cooperate both flexibly and in very large numbers.
Now, there are other animals -- like the social insects, the bees, the ants -- that can cooperate in large numbers, but they don't do so flexibly."	I guess if they took almost any one of you, and placed you alone with a chimpanzee on some island, the chimpanzee would do much better.	1
323#22	"We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see.
Coming back quickly, we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning, but these are positions, the latest positions of exoplanets that we've mapped, and our sun here, obviously, with our own solar system.
What you're going to see -- we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to where we see the solar system -- these are the paths of Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 11 and Pioneer 10, the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system."	But this our containment of the visible universe.	1

Most of the social rules and the methods of work are left completely open-ended in the software.
All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages."	So that's one tool that we can use to very quickly monitor the history of a page.	1
1848#168	"My mom takes three elements: a bit of information, which is between my father and my mom in this case, raw elements and energy in the same media, that is food, and after several months, produces me.

2079#415	"This unification model predicts the existence of these two new force particles, which should act a lot like the weak force, only weaker.
Now, we can rotate this set of charges in seven dimensions and consider an odd fact about the matter particles: the second and third generations of matter have exactly the same charges in six-dimensional charge space as the first generation.
These particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges."	The larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles that have never been seen.	1
346#371	"Second of all, if you don't have the feeling of play in you, you need to rediscover play.
Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy, that you enjoyed only six months ago, but now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy, because you feel like you have to be serious, rediscover it.
I don't care if it's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game."	If you don't believe me, well just go home and think about it some more or something.	1

Back in Haiti, people were increasingly turning to the medium of SMS.
People that were hungry and hurting were signaling their distress, were signaling their need for help."	Outside Haiti also, things were looking different.	1
1961#351	"The more I've seen and learned about our respective generations, the more I realize that we often don't trust each other enough to actually share our respective wisdom.
We may share a border, but we don't necessarily trust each other enough to share that respective wisdom.
I believe, looking at the modern workplace, that the trade agreement of our time is opening up these intergenerational pipelines of wisdom so that we can all learn from each other."	I fancied myself a modern Margaret Mead amongst the millennials, and I quickly learned that I had as much to offer them as they did to me.	1
70#281	"And that's been going on since 2014.
And I accepted the commission with the idea that I would photograph three generations of women dealing with the crisis on a daily basis.

If I was to say to you: 'You smell', you're going to take that not exactly as a compliment, are you?
But you do smell, you've just found that out, you do smell."	And in fact, when you look at the sort of words used to describe diseases, you tend to find these words: rotting, foul, putrid or pungent.	1
474#217	"Because the alternative seemed to be revolution.

These peppers measure between 1.5 and 2 million Scoville heat units, which is about half the units found in pepper spray."	The standard measure of a food's spiciness is its rating on the Scoville scale, which measures how much its capsaicin content can be diluted before the heat is no longer detectable to humans.	1

So we shamelessly absconded all of this information and tried to make human cardiovascular development happen in a dish.

And they’d come up with a bunch of interesting solutions -- and actually, quite valid solutions -- to the things that they’d been working on.

And they went back to the drawing board, and they retooled, and they came up with another plan: We don't sell you the phone, we don't sell you the monthly plan."	This is an ad for MTN, which is a South African multinational active in about 25 countries, and when they came into Nigeria — Nigeria is the big dog in Africa.	1

I always say Harlem is an interesting community because, unlike many other places, it thinks of itself in the past, present and the future simultaneously; no one speaks of it just in the now."	The point of that for me was to say -- in that space, in that moment -- that I really, more than anything, wanted to understand how images could work, how images did work, and how artists provided a space bigger than one that we could imagine in our day-to-day lives to work through these images.	1

If you look at it from that perspective, fewer than ten new men per  have joined the sub-four mile club since Sir Roger Bannister.
Now, 530 is a lot more than one, and that's partly because there are many more people training today and they're training more intelligently."	So if you apply a one and a half percent slowdown conversion to every man who ran his sub-four mile on a synthetic track, this is what happens.	1

And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind, not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being.
In fact, the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering."	But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak.	1

The masses move -- again, not according to Newton's laws, but because they see this space-time curvature and follow the little curves, just like when our bedmate nestles up to us because of the mattress curvature.
A year later, in 1916, Einstein derived from his theory that gravitational waves existed, and that these waves were produced when masses move, like, for example, when two stars revolve around one another and create folds in space-time which carry energy from the system, and the stars move toward each other."

Therefore India is at a critical point where either it can leverage its demographic dividend or it can lead to a demographic disaster."	But a demographic dividend is only as good as the investment in your human capital.	1

And one furthermore has the impulse to generalize, as much as possible, in defining who that enemy is."	The war has tremendous risks for the model that I'm describing because it's very possible that as a consequence of a war, many Muslims will conclude that the United States is not the kind of place that they want to emulate with respect to its forms of political government.	1

This illustrates the power of a conservative climate solution based on free markets and limited government.
We would end up with less regulation and far less pollution at the same time, while helping working-class Americans get ahead."	That assumes a carbon tax starting at 40 dollars per ton, which translates into roughly an extra 36 cents per gallon of gas.	1
1565#28	"Can we understand YouTube?
But we actually ran machine learning on YouTube and it discovered cats, just by itself.
Now, that's an important concept."	And we started just looking at things like YouTube.	1
203#111	"Google is one of our big partners here.
And they have an expected return on that capital.
With that capital, SolarCity purchases and installs the panel on the roof and then charges the homeowner or business owner a monthly lease payment, which is less than the utility bill."	EM: Well, essentially, SolarCity raises a chunk of capital from say, a company or a bank.	1
1423#25	"In this case, time, not force, is the key to releasing ketchup from its glassy prison.
Alright, so, why does ketchup act all weird?
Well, it's made from tomatoes, pulverized, smashed, thrashed, utterly destroyed tomatoes."	Way number two: if you push with a force below the threshold force eventually, the ketchup will start to flow.	1
372#13	"But why do I have to go to school?
But why do I have to respect the teachers and authority?
And little did I realize that this question would become the basis of everything I would do."	But why is blood red?	1
1361#218	"Some people moved to the other side of the sidewalk, moved to the other side of the elevator.
I felt like they were moving to the other side of life.
It was tough, and those were some tough years."	Some people refused to shake my hand.	1
933#250	"In fact, let's look at a model of a virus spread through the air, like the Spanish Flu back in 1918.
So here's what would happen: It would spread throughout the world very, very quickly.
And you can see over 30 million people died from that epidemic."	So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse.	1
1477#25	"Every week, every student must contribute to the class discussion, and also must comment on the contribution of others.
This way, we open our students' minds, we develop a positive shift in attitude toward different cultures.
By the end of each week, the students take a quiz, hand in their homework, which are assessed by their peers under the supervision of the instructors, get a grade, move to the next week."	Every week, when they go into the classroom, they find the lecture notes of the week, the reading assignment, the homework assignment, and the discussion question, which is the core of our studies.	1
1101#1032	"This is -- you guys know what this is.
They hadn't invented the electric socket yet.
So this was -- remember, they didn't wire the houses for electricity."	I want to point out one thing.	1
1638#75	"This is known as the Condorcet method.
Consider one matchup: West versus North.
All 100 colonists vote on their preference between the two."	Maybe what we need to do is let voters express a preference in every possible head-to-head matchup.	1
2035#102	"Progress does not mean that everything becomes better for everyone everywhere all the time.
That would be a miracle, and progress is not a miracle but problem-solving.
Problems are inevitable and solutions create new problems which have to be solved in their turn."	Of course not.	1
1800#64	"It should be a good way to reach places.
So what Yuttho did was that he explained this concept, he had Speck explain it, too, and then he applied it to the city that he was building.
So what we are seeing is Yuttho's vision of the future: lots of public transportation, walkways, plazas, connecting high-rise buildings."	The basic idea is that if you want your citizens to walk, which is kind of beneficial, you actually need to have walking as a reasonable means of transportation.	1
233#359	"So that's what we've started to do.
My team and I have built a rig, a lab rig to scan out tissue.
And here it is in action."	A system based on our technology could enable dramatically lower cost, higher resolution and smaller medical imaging.	1
112#145	"So what happened is, of course, this is just a mistake.
It's not that strove for mediocrity, it's just that the S used to be written differently, kind of like an F.
Now of course, Google didn't pick this up at the time, so we reported this in the science article that we wrote."	They didn't want to be their best, they wanted to be their beft.	1
753#208	"The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium.
And then you put tree seeds in here, and then you end up growing -- potentially -- an old-growth forest from a cardboard box.
I want to reinvent the delivery system, and the use of cardboard around the world, so they become ecological footprints."	The Life Box -- you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference -- you add soil, you add water, you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores, like of the Agarikon mushroom.	1
1815#353	"As the blood vessels tighten to minimize the bleeding, in a process known as vasoconstriction, both threats are averted by forming a blood clot.
A special protein known as fibrin forms cross-links on the top of the skin, preventing blood from flowing out and bacteria or pathogens from getting in.
After about three hours of this, the skin begins to turn red, signaling the next stage, inflammation."	The first stage, hemostasis, is the skin's response to two immediate threats: that you're now losing blood and that the physical barrier of the epidermis has been compromised.	1
271#153	"Where are you being evaluated, either by your friends?
For teenagers, it's at the lunchroom table.
For some people it's speaking at a school board meeting."	And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations, like social threat situations.	1
794#49	"I also met an amazing woman who is now the mother of my two-year-old son Sekou, and she taught me how to love myself in a healthy way.
The final thing was writing.
When I got that letter from my son, I began to write a journal about things I had experienced in my childhood and in prison, and what it did is it opened up my mind to the idea of atonement."	For 19 years, my father stood by my side with an unshakable faith, because he believed that I had what it took to turn my life around.	1
1837#253	"And this was not only she, only Malala.
I imparted all these good values to my school, girl students and boy students as well.
I used education for emancipation."	And all these good values, I tried to inculcate in her personality.	1
1618#237	"As the country grew prosperous, it was able to transition from an authoritarian government to a democratic government and has been able to reinvest in building its institutions.
And this has paid off tremendously.
For instance, in 2018, South Korea's president was sentenced to 25 years in prison on corruption-related charges."	But as companies like Samsung, Kia, Hyundai invested in innovations that made things much more affordable for so many more people, South Korea ultimately became prosperous.	1
805#46	"And I realized that if I was going to ask my students to speak up, I was going to have to tell my truth and be honest with them about the times where I failed to do so.
So I tell them that growing up, as a kid in a Catholic family in New Orleans, during Lent I was always taught that the most meaningful thing one could do was to give something up, sacrifice something you typically indulge in to prove to God you understand his sanctity.
I've given up soda, McDonald's, French fries, French kisses, and everything in between."	And I find myself thinking a lot about that last point, tell your truth.	1
1782#270	"I'm sure many of you remember a distant time when we had to know phone numbers, when we knew our friends' phone numbers.
And suddenly there was a machine that did that, and now we don't need to remember that anymore.
I have read that there's now actually evidence that the hippocampus, the part of our brain that handles spacial relationships, physically shrinks and atrophies in people who use tools like GPS, because we're not exercising our sense of direction anymore."	And it made me think, what does this mean, if we're going to be able to start outsourcing, not just lower unimportant brain functions.	1
1272#146	"Maldives is a long archipelago.
It stretches about 500 miles, of course it's India here.

But even I, in my mulishness, even I have brushed up against that thing, at times.
And I would imagine that a lot of you have too."	That's not at all what my creative process is -- I'm not the pipeline!	1
1261#95	"But I think what's happened is that this focus on generational cohorts, these groups of people, has created a space where we just forgot that people are people.
And to know who they really are, who we really work with, we have to figure out how to better navigate this multigenerational workplace than ball pits.
Call me one of those idealist millennials, but I think we can get there."	At least when it comes to things happening outside of work.	1

Then, by using multiple photos, in this case, it can begin to reconstruct the object in 3D."	Let me show you how it works.	1
1605#30	"The real money is being made in that other chemical -- in THC.
THC is the natural part of the plant that gets you high.
And before the 1970s, cannabis contained less than half of a percent of THC."	Now, for as interesting and remarkable a part of the plant as CBD is, it actually makes up a really tiny portion of the commercial market.	1
347#67	"Not only did this virus continue in the places where they'd already become infected, but then it started to escalate and we saw the case numbers that you see here, something we'd never seen before on such a scale, an exponential increase of Ebola cases not just in these countries or the areas already infected in these countries but also spreading further and deeper into these countries.
Ladies and gentleman, this was one of the most concerning international emergencies in public health we've ever seen.
And what happened in these countries then, many of you saw, again, on the television, read about in the newspapers, we saw the health system start to collapse under the weight of this epidemic."	And what we saw then was something also we hadn't seen before.	1
1614#270	"We had no idea what was causing this disease.
The hypothesis was actually it was your constitution that made you susceptible.
And it was a highly romanticized disease."	This is a tuberculosis ward, and at the time this picture was taken in the late 1800s, one in seven of all people died from tuberculosis.	1

Because laptop economics are the following: I say 50 percent here -- it's more like 60, 60 percent of the cost of your laptop is sales, marketing, distribution and profit."	Well, no, it's not a laptop project.	1
499#19	"At one point, I even tried to break up with my girlfriend because trying to take into account her preferences as well as my own and then find perfect solutions --  was just leaving me exhausted.
She pointed out that I was taking the wrong approach to solving this problem -- and she later became my wife.
Whether it's as basic as trying to decide what restaurant to go to or as important as trying to decide who to spend the rest of your life with, human lives are filled with computational problems that are just too hard to solve by applying sheer effort."

I started to learn classic ballet, jazz dance, acrobatics and other things to make my performance better.
As a result of these efforts, and the help of many others, it happened."	So I started to consider what I should do, and I thought, I wanted to make my performance better, and to show onstage how spectacular the yo-yo could be to change the public's image of the yo-yo.	1
159#76	"And the limiting step here wasn't the unknown diversity of life, but rather the taxonomic specialists who can identify and catalog these species that became the limiting step.
They, in fact, are an endangered species themselves.

1939#193	"And in the next few weeks, I had the tremendous pleasure of introducing these kids to the world of total freedom, a world consisting of magnificent vistas like these -- everything you see here is obviously in Israel -- as well as close encounters with all sorts of small creatures coming in all sorts of sizes, colors, shapes, forms and so on.
In spite of all this splendor, the beginning was extremely frustrating.
Every small obstacle, every slight uphill, would cause these fellows to stop in their tracks and give up."

Instead he taught me what he knew: that being a man was about sacrifice and doing whatever you can to take care of and provide for your family.
But there was another role I learned how to play from my dad, who, I discovered, learned it from his dad, a state senator who later in life had to work nights as a janitor to support his family, and he never told a soul."	See, my dad wasn't traditionally masculine, so he didn't teach me how to use my hands.	1
