129#297	"So one of the things that I started to question is, are there ways to make innovation easier and happen more frequently?
Is there a way to take those aha moments, those breakthroughs that seem to happen randomly and occasionally, and have them happen intentionally and frequently?
When we started Blue Man Group in 1988, we had never done an off-Broadway show before."	We'd actually done almost no theater.	1
929#31	"It began with ice cream.
There was a Baskin-Robbins in my hometown, and they served ice cream from behind the counter in these giant, five-gallon, cardboard tubs.
And someone told me -- I was eight years old -- someone told me that when they were done with those tubs, they washed them out and kept them in the back, and if you asked they would give you one."	It took me a couple of weeks to work up the courage, but I did, and they did.	1

And we'll grow it as a moral force in the world, finding out those terrible things before anybody else knows about them, and sending our response to them, so that next year, instead of us meeting here, lamenting how many terrible things there are in the world, we will have pulled together, used the unique skills and the magic of this community, and be proud that we have done everything we can to stop pandemics, other catastrophes, and change the world, beginning right now.	1
1163#105	"And at the same time, I'm pursuing my PhD.
In all of these different institutions, the research and publication process works the same way.
First, scholars produce research in their fields."	To fund their research, they apply for public and private grants and after the research is finished, they write a paper about their findings.	1
2042#61	"For example, a letter is represented in one byte, or eight bits, and your average photo takes up several megabytes, each of which is 8 million bits.
Because each bit must be written onto a physical area of the disc, we're always seeking to increase the disc's areal density, or how many bits can be squeezed into one square inch.
The areal density of a modern hard drive is about 600 gigabits per square inch, 300 million times greater than that of IBM's first hard drive from 1957."	This amazing advance in storage capacity wasn't just a matter of making everything smaller, but involved multiple innovations.	1

That's where hobbies happen, where we have close relationships, where we really think about our lives, where we get creative, where we zoom back and try to work out whether our lives have been meaningful.
We get some of that from work as well, but when people look back on their lives and wonder what their lives have been like at the end of their lives, you look at the last things they say -- they are talking about those moments that happen in that white personal space."	So it's sacred; it's important to us.	1

But we made that movie deliberately to show what a real pandemic looked like, but we did choose a pretty awful virus."	And the reason we showed it like that, going from a bat to an apple, to a pig, to a cook, to Gwyneth Paltrow, was because that is in nature what we call spillover, as zoonotic diseases, diseases of animals, spill over to human beings.	1
1512#43	"Jamal finally decided to read something that he had written out loud in class, and sure enough, Jamal stunned all of us with his brilliance.
Just like Jamal's dad, John McCain was a veteran, and just like Jamal's dad protected him, Jamal believed that John McCain would protect the entire country.
And he wasn't my candidate of choice, but it didn't matter, because the entire class erupted into applause, a standing ovation for our brave friend Jamal who finally showed up as his most confident self for the first time that year."	And then there was Regina.	1
1665#148	"I mean, there's no paper on the desk.
We want this golden world.
And some people get rich enough, and if they have their ideals -- in a sort of domestic sense, they get to acquire their perfect world."	Dean Koontz built this fabulous home theater, which is -- I don't think accidentally -- in Art Deco style.	1

407#185	"Individuals in innovative organizations learn how to inquire, they learn how to actively listen, but guess what?
They also learn how to advocate for their point of view.
They understand that innovation rarely happens unless you have both diversity and conflict."	Creative agility is about being able to test and refine that portfolio of ideas through quick pursuit, reflection and adjustment.	1
1946#455	"Even by people who didn't mean to alienate me.
For example: we would, like everyone does, take family pictures, and my mom would bring a little top of makeup, and it was her makeup.

Imagine, we had an 89¢ can of soup that was costing us one dollar to pick and pack into that tote.

And the first place we've done that is in Southern Siberia in the Altai Mountains at a place called Denisova, a cave site in this mountain here, where archeologists in 2008 found a tiny little piece of bone -- this is a copy of it -- that they realized came from the last phalanx of a little finger of a pinky of a human.
And it was well enough preserved so we could determine the DNA from this individual, even to a greater extent than for the Neanderthals actually, and start relating it to the Neanderthal genome and to people today."	And we found that this individual shared a common origin for his DNA sequences with Neanderthals around 640,000 years ago.	1

662#402	"And it's led to a view of human nature that we're rational individuals who respond in straightforward ways to incentives, and it's led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior is.
And it's produced a great amputation, a shallow view of human nature.
We're really good at talking about material things, but we're really bad at talking about emotions."	We're really good at talking about skills and safety and health; we're really bad at talking about character.	1
1114#49	"Without Iraq balancing Iran, Iran could now become a threat, some in Israel argued.
In fact, the current dynamic that you see between Iran and Israel has its roots more so in the geopolitical reconfiguration of the region after the Cold War than in the events of 1979, because at this point, Iran and Israel emerge as two of the most powerful states in the region, and rather than viewing each other as potential security partners, they increasingly came to view each other as rivals and competitors.
So Israel, who in the 1980s lobbied for and improved U.S.-Iran relations now feared a U.S.-Iran rapprochement, thinking that it would come at Israel's security interests' expense, and instead sought to put Iran in increased isolation."	Ironically, this was happening at a time when Iran was more interested in peacemaking with Washington than to see to Israel's destruction.	1

What happens then actually is that you lose the grounding of the self, you have no longer access to any feeling of your own existence, and, in fact, there can be images going on, being formed in the cerebral cortex, except you don't know they're there."

You're showing you're invested in their success, but also that you care about their well-being."	When we can be honest about what we feel, and freely suggest ideas, make mistakes and just not have to hide every piece of who we are, we're much more likely to stay at the company for a long time.	1

They have also, to a lesser extent, invited people to participate in improving the outcome of decisions that were already made for them, just like my mom when I was eight and she told me that I had a choice: I had to be in bed by 8 p.m., but I could choose my pink pajamas or my blue pajamas.
That's not participation, and in fact, governments have not been very good at using technology to enable participation on what matters — the way we allocate our budget, the way we occupy our land, and the way we manage our natural resources."

So, not only does each type of pollen look different, but each habitat has a different combination of plants.
A different pollen signature, if you like, or a different pollen fingerprint."	By looking at the proportions and combinations of different kinds of pollen in a sample, you can tell very precisely where it came from.	1

397#590	"Files and programs consist of millions of these bits, all processed in the central processing unit, or CPU, that acts as the computer's brain.
And as the number of bits needing to be processed grows exponentially, computer designers face a constant struggle between size, cost, and speed.
Like us, computers have short-term memory for immediate tasks, and long-term memory for more permanent storage."	When you run a program, your operating system allocates area within the short-term memory for performing those instructions.	1
1380#113	"My interest is in the present.
And I'd like to show you how the past can help us understand the present.
There's nothing that summarizes both the promise and the danger of efficiency like the humble potato."	The potato originated in the Andes and it spread to Europe from the ancient Inca.	1
1392#147	"And then right below that the processing, and the mission lift, and the mission control room, and all the other spaces are underground.
And what you look at is an aircraft carrier that's performance-driven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes.
And that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion, broken up by a series of courts, and it's five acres of uninterrupted, horizontal space for their administrative offices."	And then that, in turn, propelled us to look at larger-scale projects where this notion of landscape building interface becomes a connective tissue.	1
1450#25	"It was in the skating rink.

164#28	"It is possible for a candidate to not get a single person's vote -- not one vote -- in 39 states, or the District of Columbia, yet be elected president by winning the popular vote in just 11 of these 12 states: California, New York, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Georgia or Virginia.
This is why both parties pay attention to these states.
However, others argue that the electoral college protects small states such as Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire, and even geographically large states with small populations like Alaska, Wyoming and the Dakotas."	That's because a candidate can't completely ignore small states, because in a close election, every electoral vote counts.	1
903#37	"A forest can be an integral part of our urban existence.
A forest, for me, is a place so dense with trees that you just can't walk into it.
It doesn't matter how big or small they are."	Most of the world we live in today was forest.	1
1665#480	"If I were John, I'd ask to start flying the plane.
For my 13th birthday, my grandpa, a former Navy pilot, gave me the gift of being able to fly a very small plane.
Once we were safely airborne, the pilot turned over the controls, folded his hands, and he let me fly."	It was totally terrifying.	1
1272#380	"But of course, when you climb onto the Boeing 787, you are not going to know that this is invisible innovation out of India.
The third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India is what we call process innovations, because of an injection of intelligence by Indian firms.
Process innovation is different from product innovation."	It's about how do you create a new product or develop a new product or manufacture a new product, but not a new product itself?	1
31#242	"But organizations such as mine that fight for consumers' rights can't be everywhere.
Nor can consumers fix this on their own, because if we know that something innocent we said will come back to haunt us, we will stop speaking.
If we know that we are being watched and monitored, we will change our behavior."	And if we can't control who has our data and how it is being used, we have lost the control of our lives.	1

And you'll see that the human, chimp and bonobo all have external testicles, which in our book we equate to a special fridge you have in the garage just for beer.
If you're the kind of guy who has a beer fridge in the garage, you expect a party to happen at any moment, and you need to be ready."	That's what the external testicles are.	1
619#76	"And that's when I realized that a fangirl's shriek is therefore like a superpower.
Because it's this fearless and honest expression of pure celebration and joy, and it's a sound they have not forgotten how to make.
I actually reckon that fangirls have a second superpower, because they know how to do something that most of my adult friends have no idea how to do."	Fangirls know how to love something without apology or fear.	1

""When I've asked the question around the world when people feel comfortable speaking up, the number one answer is: """"When I have social support in my audience; when I have allies."""""""	So we want to get allies on our side.	1

""The """"Green river,"""" as a kind of activist idea, not a part of an exhibition, it was really about showing people, in this city, as they walk by, that space has dimensions.""
A space has time."	And the water flows through the city with time.	1

And now I'm highlighting a few dots.

And the answer is, yes, we can, and we did."	Of course, the accuracy keeps getting worse.	1
1310#49	"When in the 19th century people were choking from the soot of the dark, satanic mills, the planners said, hey, let's move the housing away from the mills.
And lifespans increased immediately, dramatically, and we like to say the planners have been trying to repeat that experience ever since.
So there's the onset of what we call Euclidean zoning, the separation of the landscape into large areas of single use."	And typically when I arrive in a city to do a plan, a plan like this already awaits me on the property that I'm looking at.	1

So initially, I felt limited.

That's just a matter of anatomy and reproductive tracts, and people could choose whatever gender they want if they weren't forced by society into categories of either male or female the way South Africa used to force people into categories of black or white.
We know from anthropological science that race is fiction, even though racism is very, very real, and we now know from cultural studies that separate male or female genders is a constructed fiction."	The reality is a gender fluidity that crosses the entire continuum from male to female.	1

So my decision to run ultimately came down to the fact that I felt that I had to do my bit, even if I had no political experience, to step up and try to be part of creating the world that will make sense and be sustainable for our kids, and a world where we truly allow both our boys and girls to be all they can be.	1

2175#16	"The good news is, we have more.
Thanks to human ingenuity, we have the technology today to remove CO2 out of the air using a chemically manufactured approach.

Loyalties are fickle."	Management teams seem increasingly disconnected from their staff.	1
680#35	"Why do some but not all young children lie?
In cooking, you need good ingredients to cook good food.
And good lying requires two key ingredients."	The first key ingredient is theory of mind, or the mind-reading ability.	1
463#344	"And actually the stories that we tell ourselves, we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here.
And one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories out of what people are doing.
Stories about the community that's produced its own 21 pound note, for example, the school that's turned its car park into a food garden, the community that's founded its own energy company."	And for me, one of the great stories recently was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House to create a vegetable garden.	1
2166#75	"And we found over 100,000 species of bacteria and fungi that live in our dust bunnies, thousands more that live on our clothes or in our showers.
We've gone further still, and we looked at the microorganisms that live inside the bodies of each of those bugs in our home.
In each bug, for example, a wasp, we see a microscopic jungle unfold in a petri plate, a world of hundreds of vibrant species."	Behold the biological cosmos!	1
1769#67	"Every apartment is unique, and this individuality tells a story about each family's circumstances and values.
Many of these people take their homes and interior spaces very seriously, putting a lot of work and care into the details.
The shared spaces are also treated in the same manner, where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns."	But despite this elaborate decor, sometimes these apartments are used in very unexpected ways, like this home which caught my attention while all the mud and the grass was literally seeping out under the front door.	1
2123#301	"But this one's kind of cool.
So this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had, with a difference.
In this case, at the end of the bypass operation, you're going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient."	And I'm standing up here because at one point I'm going to show you just how early this technology is.	1

332#232	"And we know that in the future it will enable us to improve and facilitate communication.
But these studies also reveal that communication relies on a common ground.
And we have to be really worried as a society if we lose this common ground and our ability to speak with people that are slightly different than us because we let a few very strong media channels take control of the mic, and manipulate and control the way we all think."	And I'm not sure how to fix it because I'm only a scientist.	1
903#479	"That is more Big Macs than McDonald's has ever produced.
So how did we get to these numbers in the first place?

1340#49	"By having a song that explained what was happening to me, while it was happening, that gave the audience permission to think about it.
They didn't have to feel bad for me because I was nervous, they could experience that with me, and we were all one big happy, nervous, uncomfortable family.
By thinking about my audience, by embracing and exploiting my problem, I was able to take something that was blocking my progress, and turn it into something that was essential for my success."	And having the stage fright song let me get past that biggest issue right in the beginning of a performance.	1
2163#298	"What does Granny say?
""She says, """"I'm in heaven and it's wonderful.""

2188#220	"""So the average Western first-grader spends as much as 50 percent of their play time taking part in what’s called """"construction play.""""""
Construction play -- it’s playful, obviously, but also a powerful way to learn.

1933#37	"The thing that unites bilaterally symmetric animals is that their bodies are designed around movement.
If you want to pick one direction and move that way, it helps to have a front end where you can group your sensory organs-- your eyes, ears and nose.
It helps to have your mouth there too since you're more likely to run into food or enemies from this end."	You're probably familiar with a name for a group of organs, plus a mouth, mounted on the front of an animal's body.	1
1815#285	"If they see someone in a wheelchair, they yield by pointing themselves away from the sidewalk, to signal that they're not going to move.

After every use I would wash and reuse them.
But to store them, I would hide and keep it in a dark, damp place so that nobody finds out that I'm menstruating."	Due to repeated washing the rags would become coarse, and I would often get rashes and infections using them.	1
246#22	"Some believe this incident alone set East/West relations back a decade.
As it turns out, Khrushchev's remark was translated a bit too literally.
""Given the context, his words should have been rendered as, """"We will live to see you buried,"""" meaning that Communism would outlast Capitalism, a less threatening comment."""	Though the intended meaning was eventually clarified, the initial impact of Khrushchev's apparent words put the world on a path that could have led to nuclear armageddon.	1
169#238	"Previously, it was believed that scientific knowledge ought to be used for the good of the king or queen, or for one's own personal gain.
For example, ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports.
Harbormasters would gather this knowledge and sell it to the ship captains."	The philosophical breakfast club changed that, working together.	1
2159#131	"So what the banks used to give us -- trustworthy digital money transfer -- we can now get with a clever application of cryptography.
And this means that we don't have to rely on the banks anymore to secure our transactions.

1460#196	"You can go there with other people, have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses.
""""""Experience beamers,"""" I call them, will put their whole flow of sensory experiences in the neurological correlates of their emotions out on the Internet.""

324#13	"After the second person sits down, only two people are left as candidates for the third chair.
And after the third person has sat down, the last person standing has no choice but to sit in the fourth chair.
If we manually write out all the possible arrangements, or permutations, it turns out that there are 24 ways that four people can be seated into four chairs, but when dealing with larger numbers, this can take quite a while."	So let's see if there's a quicker way.	1

It was authentic.
It meant something to them."	And they will step up.	1
1738#87	"But similarly, I instruct new doctors: when they walk into a patient's room, before they pick up that medical chart, just look around the room.
Are there balloons or cards, or that special blanket on the bed?
That tells the doctor there's a connection to the outside world."	If that patient has someone in the outside world to assist them and help them, the doctor can implement the best care with that connection in mind.	1
1101#630	"This may actually be heresy to say this at TED, but I'd like to introduce you to the most important innovation, I think, in medicine to come in the next 10 years, and that is the power of the human hand -- to touch, to comfort, to diagnose and to bring about treatment.
I'd like to introduce you first to this person whose image you may or may not recognize.

1418#82	"There were a lot of reasons people told me why we don't have enough telephones.
And one of them is the lacking buying power.
Poor people apparently don't have the power to buy."	But the point is, if it's a production tool, why do we have to worry about that?	1
2184#67	"The same is true in our workplaces.
In the companies I consult with, I often see flawless execution cultures which leaders foster to encourage great work.
But that leads employees to stay within what they know and not try new things, so companies struggle to innovate and improve, and they fall behind."	We can create more spaces for growth by starting conversations with one another about when we want to be in each zone.	1
1829#232	"Proteins are being used today for an increasingly broad range of different applications, from materials that protect soldiers from injury to devices that detect dangerous compounds, but at least to me, the most exciting application is protein drugs.
Despite being relatively new, protein drugs have already revolutionized medicine, and, for example, insulin is a protein.
You've probably heard of it, and it's manufactured as a drug that has completely changed how we treat diabetes."	But the problem is that proteins are really hard to make and the only practical way to get them is to get cells to make them for you.	1
480#106	"When you learn to read and write, it opens up opportunities for you to learn so many other things.
When you learn to read, you can then read to learn.

1127#326	"The thing is becoming faster and that's why I think it seems so confusing.
Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves.
We're taking off."	And what we are is we're at a point in time which is analogous to when single-celled organisms were turning into multi-celled organisms.	1
198#61	"How does it work?
In order to work on this question and to figure out how someone goes from meeting on a date to having a life together, Stacey and I went to Sun City Summerlin, which is the largest retirement community in Las Vegas.

385#181	"On weekends, I love rockets.
I love photography, I love rockets.
I'm going to talk about a hobby that can scale and show you photos I've taken over the years with kids like these, that hopefully will grow up to love rocketry and eventually become a Richard Branson or Diamandis."	My son designed a rocket that became stable, a golf ball rocket.	1
1056#19	"Well, you see, this prolapse was so delicate, I could practically see myself pulling it out of the nerve root canal before she entered the consultation room.

2124#57	"Because the light-activated pore is encoded in DNA, we can achieve incredible precision.
This is because, although each cell in our bodies contains the same set of genes, different mixes of genes get turned on and off in different cells.
You can exploit this to make sure that only some neurons contain our light-activated pore and others don't."	So in this cartoon, the bluish white cell in the upper-left corner does not respond to light because it lacks the light-activated pore.	1
687#213	"This time we covered the roofs of the houses, but we didn't use paper, because paper doesn't prevent the rain from leaking inside the house -- vinyl does.
Then art becomes useful.

1629#406	"So the groups of four friends, they only had a 50-50 chance of getting the answer right.

That's quite a big leap in performance.	1
1036#365	"And then you can send it to the Kinko's store at the corner and go get your chair.
Now, the implications of this are enormous, not only regarding the participation of the final buyer in the design process, but also no tracking, no warehousing, no wasted materials.

1829#214	"Conceptually, people have thought about life, what it is, what makes it different from things that are not alive, since people have had thoughts.
Many have interpreted life as being perfect, and this was taken as evidence of a creator.
Living things are different because a god breathed life into them."	Others have sought a more scientific explanation, but I think it's fair to say that they still consider the molecules of life to be special.	1
1711#94	"But look in the southern hemisphere.
In the southern hemisphere there are impact craters, there are volcanic craters.
Here's Hellas Basin, a very very different place, geologically."	Look where the methane is, the methane is in a very rough terrain area.	1
63#255	"In a storyteller's mind, it's a contradiction of moralities.
In a poet's mind, it's a conflict of words, in the universe's mind, between day and night.
In the mind of a man and a woman, we're looking constantly at the contradiction between male and female, we're looking for harmony within each other."	The whole idea of contradiction, but the acceptance of contradiction is the telling of a story, not the resolution.	1

2066#413	"Now check this out.
If you divide 13 by eight, you get 1.625.
And if you divide the larger number by the smaller number, then these ratios get closer and closer to about 1.618, known to many people as the Golden Ratio, a number which has fascinated mathematicians, scientists and artists for centuries."	Now, I show all this to you because, like so much of mathematics, there's a beautiful side to it that I fear does not get enough attention in our schools.	1
2107#79	"And your outward voice travels through the air while your inward voice travels through your bones.
This is called bone conduction.
Because of this, your inward voice is going to sound in a lower register and also more musically harmonical than your outward voice."	Once it travels there, it has to access your inner ear.	1
1711#73	"Because on Earth, almost all -- 99.9 percent -- of the methane is produced by living systems, not little green men, but microscopic life below the surface or at the surface.
We now have evidence that methane is in the atmosphere of Mars, a gas that, on Earth, is biogenic in origin, produced by living systems.
These are the three plumes: A, B1, B2."	And this is the terrain it appears over, and we know from geological studies that these regions are the oldest regions on Mars.	1

7#71	"The feminine beauty.
Curvy models are becoming more and more vocal about the isolating nature of the term plus size.

We even found that conservatives who read the moral purity essay were significantly more likely to say that they believed in global warming and were concerned about global warming, even though this essay didn't even mention global warming.
That's just a related environmental issue."	But that's how robust this moral reframing effect was.	1

Because as soon as we gave ourselves permission to dream, those threads connecting much of our work became self-evident.
We realized, for instance, that the bottomless quest for profits that is forcing so many people to work more than 50 hours a week, without security, and that is fueling this epidemic of despair is the same quest for bottomless profits and endless growth that is at the heart of our ecological crisis and is destabilizing our planet."	It also became clear what we need to do.	1

Now, since these migration events are giving the context of families, we can ask questions such as: What is the typical distance between the birth locations of husbands and wives?"

Well, I think one of the solutions we may have is to study some viruses that routinely jump from wild animals into people, or into our pets, or our livestock, even if they're not the same viruses that we think are going to cause pandemics.
If we can use those everyday killer viruses to work out some of the patterns of what drives that initial, crucial jump from one species to the next, and, potentially, how we might stop it, then we're going to end up better prepared for those viruses that jump between species more rarely but pose a greater threat of pandemics."	Now, rabies, as terrible as it is, turns out to be a pretty nice virus in this case.	1

2127#270	"Another kind of biomolecule might get a red color.
And so forth.

Police departments already practice data-driven accountability, it's just for crime.

Even though we have traces when we try to understand them, the perception and context play a major role to understand it.

425#661	"But I think it's very important to have all this information.

149#40	"Now among them is one of my great design heroes, the brilliant László Moholy-Nagy.
He was the Hungarian artist and designer whose experiments with the impact of technology on daily life were so powerful that they still influence the design of the digital images we see on our phone and computer screens.
He radicalized the Bauhaus Design School in 1920s Germany, and yet some of his former colleagues shunned him when he struggled to open a new Bauhaus in Chicago years later."	Moholy's ideas were as bold and incisive as ever, but his approach to design was too experimental, as was his insistence on seeing it, as he put it, as an attitude, not a profession to be in tune with the times.	1

His deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was a pediatrician -- not an ill-educated man.

166#127	"It doesn't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look, you cannot copyright the sculptural design.

1721#55	"I had that condition, to a certain extent, from my own childhood illness.
Eve Ensler, whom you'll hear later, has had that condition activated amazingly in her through the various waters of suffering that she has been through.

1171#70	"E-cigarettes can expose teens to a lot of nicotine.
Many of these devices contain the amount of nicotine that is in a full pack of cigarettes.
The more recent pod devices contain a nicotine salt, which has a smoother taste and is much easier to use and can produce rapid increases in brain nicotine levels."	Teens who use e-cigarettes regularly report symptoms of craving -- feeling anxious when they don't have their e-cigarettes.	1
698#242	"And this is quite an extraordinary idea, but it is reality today.
So all these products that you can see on the screen were made in the same way.
They were all 3D printed."	And you can see, they're ranging from shoes, rings that were made out of stainless steal, phone covers out of plastic, all the way through to spinal implants, for example, that were created out of medical-grade titanium, and engine parts.	1
1677#96	"It's the power of focus.
It's the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you, so moves you, that something even like cancer becomes insignificant.

1204#37	"KK: Thanks so much, Vivek.

564#59	"But 4.5 billion years ago, when the Sun formed in a cocoon of hundreds of other stars, any one of those stars could have gotten just a little bit too close to Sedna and perturbed it onto the orbit that it has today.
When that cluster of stars dissipated into the galaxy, the orbit of Sedna would have been left as a fossil record of this earliest history of the Sun.
I was so excited by this idea, by the idea that we could look at the fossil history of the birth of the Sun, that I spent the next decade looking for more objects with orbits like Sedna."	In that ten-year period, I found zero.	1

And we've just recently demonstrated this by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads, and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate.
And it turns out that ants will respond to the right rate of contact with a glass bead with hydrocarbon extract on it, as they would to contact with real ants."	So I want now to show you a bit of film -- and this will start out, first of all, showing you the nest entrance.	1
487#130	"There had been some indications that some of the species, in particular the bigeye, was under serious threat.
The yellowfin was also heavily fished.
Skipjack remains healthy."	And so we had to do something like that, and so that was the reason I did that.	1
1251#16	"This had one benefit for the Celts: the Romans protected them from the barbarian Saxon tribes of Northern Europe.
But then the Roman Empire began to crumble, and the Romans withdrew from Britain.
With the Romans gone, the Germanic tribes, the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians quickly sailed across the water, did away with the Celts, and formed kingdoms in the British Isles."	For several centuries, these tribes lived in Britain, and their Germanic language, Anglo Saxon, became the common language, what we call Old English.	1

This year, Germany is celebrating the 25th anniversary of the peaceful revolution in East Germany.
In 1989, the Communist regime was moved away, the Berlin Wall came down, and one year later, the German Democratic Republic, the GDR, in the East was unified with the Federal Republic of Germany in the West to found today's Germany."	Among many other things, Germany inherited the archives of the East German secret police, known as the Stasi.	1

And if we really want to get out of this economic mess, if we really want high performance on those definitional tasks of the 21st century, the solution is not to do more of the wrong things, to entice people with a sweeter carrot, or threaten them with a sharper stick."

It is on the World Health Organization list of most essential medicines.
If we had discovered ketamine as a paravaccine first, it'd be pretty easy for us to develop it, but as is, we have to compete with our functional fixedness and mental set that kind of interfere."	Fortunately, it's not the only compound we have discovered that has these prophylactic, paravaccine qualities, but all of the other drugs we've discovered, or compounds if you will, they're totally new, they have to go through the entire FDA approval process -- if they make it before they can ever be used in humans.	1
874#267	"The path forward is really pretty clear.
Number one: We have to start making stopping violence indispensable to the fight against poverty.
In fact, any conversation about global poverty that doesn't include the problem of violence must be deemed not serious."	And secondly, we have to begin to seriously invest resources and share expertise to support the developing world as they fashion new, public systems of justice, not private security, that give everybody a chance to be safe.	1

And that's led to a whole field, really, that has looked at developing materials that have this hybrid kind of structure.
And so I'm showing here just two examples where we've made some materials that have that sort of structure, and you can really tailor it."	You can see here a very squishy one and now a material that's also this hybrid sort of material but actually has remarkable toughness, and it's no longer brittle.	1

Amazingly, while we all engage with beauty, without our knowledge, beauty also engages us.

Most AI researchers expect AGI within decades, and if we just bumble into this unprepared, it will probably be the biggest mistake in human history -- let's face it."	It could enable brutal, global dictatorship with unprecedented inequality, surveillance and suffering, and maybe even human extinction.	1

The key to surviving a nuclear blast is getting out, and not going into harm's way.
That's basically all we're going to be talking about here."	And the farther you are away in distance, the longer it is in time from the initial blast; and the more separation between you and the outside atmosphere, the better.	1
1216#210	"And crucially, the Civil Rights Movement innovated tactically from boycotts to lunch counter sit-ins to pickets to marches to freedom rides.
Today's movements scale up very quickly without the organizational base that can see them through the challenges.

1928#155	"And in fact, he painted four versions of this painting, different boys building houses of cards, all concentrated.

721#184	"At any age, as with many other drugs, the brain and body become less sensitive to marijuana after repeated uses, meaning it takes more to achieve the same effects.
Fortunately, unlike many other drugs, there’s no risk of fatal overdose from marijuana, and even heavy use doesn’t lead to debilitating or life-threatening withdrawal symptoms if use stops.
There are more subtle forms of marijuana withdrawal, though, including sleep disturbances, irritability, and depressed mood, which pass within a few weeks of stopping use."	So is marijuana bad for your brain?	1

2187#214	"You see, this was only a few years after the supposed flying saucer crash at Roswell, New Mexico.
And even though that turned out to be nothing, nothing at all --  -- merely a downed weather balloon piloted by small hairless men with slits for mouths ...

535#34	"Now, it is surprising, isn't it, that this would be the case.
I mean, there are two issues involved here.
There's police violence against African-Americans, and there's violence against women, two issues that have been talked about a lot lately."	But when we think about who is implicated by these problems, when we think about who is victimized by these problems, the names of these black women never come to mind.	1
506#47	"A heroic effort is a collective effort, number one.
Number two, it's imperfect; it's not very glamorous, and doesn't suddenly start and suddenly end.

1914#94	"That is, you have six with 23 zeros after it particles of gas in the container.
Or in scientific notation, 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd particles.
This example is a little misleading, because gases take up a lot of space due to the high kinetic energy of the gas particles, and it leaves you thinking atoms are bigger than they really are."	Instead, think of water molecules.	1
1223#51	"I can also make him spin.

Unfortunately, that's a problem: they get a little too close, and when you're in a dirigible you have to be very careful about spikes."	So that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion.	1

I'd been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements, like a person's race or religion."	So what opened my eyes?	1
1305#504	"Let's watch a couple more clips.
So with all these theatric elements, this pushes me in another role, and that would be, possibly, the dramaturge.

This is the fastest street-legal car in the world and the most expensive production car.
I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company, a professional race car driver, and we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angeles and down on the Pacific Coast Highway."	And, you know, when we pulled up to a stoplight the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods.	1
1614#387	"We had accidentally discovered the first resilience-enhancing drug.
And like I said, we only gave a tiny amount of the drug, and it lasted for weeks, and that's not like anything you see with antidepressants.
But it is actually kind of similar to what you see in immune vaccines."	So in immune vaccines, you'll get your shots, and then weeks, months, years later, when you're actually exposed to bacteria, it's not the vaccine in your body that protects you.	1
808#219	"I have 18 out of the 19 signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed.

1185#224	"We are a nine through 12 public school, but we do school quite differently.
I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learned, and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you are willing to let go of some of the paradigms of the past, of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school, and to a moment when we have information surplus.
So what do you do when the information is all around you?"	Why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information?	1
324#184	"And let's explore this notion of simplicity.
So I think, unfortunately, a lot of neuroscientists, we're all somewhat narcissistic.
When we think of brain, we of course imagine our own brain."	But remember that this kind of brain, which is much, much smaller — instead of 100 billion neurons, it has 100,000 neurons — but this is the most common form of brain on the planet and has been for 400 million years.	1

If so, that's going to require that our inventions are as important as the ones that happened over the last 150 years.

1283#426	"I think we've always been at that moment.
But this moment is different, because of the void in leadership.

So we end up with this bizarre legal situation where two 17-year-olds can legally have sex in most US states but they can't photograph it.
Some states have also tried passing sexting misdemeanor laws but these laws repeat the same problem because they still make consensual sexting illegal."	It doesn't make sense to try to ban all sexting to try to address privacy violations.	1
2036#215	"And so, I implore everyone here: Think differently.
Come up with new ideas.
Tell them to me or anyone else in our field, because over the last 59 years, nothing has changed."	We need a radically different approach.	1

1865#191	"I don't think they're bad people.
As a matter of fact, I would argue that there's a lot of very civic-minded, decent leadership.
But this is the issue: when you control 90 percent points of share in a market, search, that is now bigger than the entire advertising market of any nation, and you're primarily compensated and trying to develop economic security for you and the families of your employees, to increase that market share, you can't help but leverage all the power at your disposal."	And that is the basis for regulation, and it's the basis for the truism throughout history that power corrupts.	1
568#320	"Perhaps more interesting about this little engine is it'll burn any fuel, because some of you might be skeptical about the capability of this to have an impact, where most of the world you can't simply plug into your 120-volt outlet.
We've been working on this, actually, as an alternative energy source, starting way back with Johnson &amp; Johnson, to run an iBOT, because the best batteries you could get -- 10 watt-hours per kilogram in lead, 20 watt-hours per kilogram nickel-cadmium, 40 watt-hours per kilogram in nickel-metal hydride, 60 watt-hours per kilogram in lithium, 8,750 watt-hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline -- which is why nobody drives electric cars.
But, in any event, if you can burn it with the same efficiency -- because it's external combustion -- as your kitchen stove, if you can burn any fuel, it turns out to be pretty neat."	It makes just enough electricity to, for instance, do this, which at night is enough electricity, in the rest of the world, as Mr. Holly -- Dr. Holly -- pointed out, can run computers and a light bulb.	1

We can learn from Agbogbloshie, where cobblers remake work boots, where women collect plastic from all over the city, sort it by type, shred it, wash it and ultimately sell it back as feedstock to factories to make new clothing, new plastic buckets and chairs.
Steel is stockpiled separately, where the carcasses of cars and microwaves and washing machines become iron rods for new construction; where roofing sheets become cookstoves; where shafts from cars become chisels that are used to scrap more objects; where aluminum recovered from the radiators of fridges and air conditioners are melted down and use sand casting to make ornaments for the building industry, for pots which are sold just down the street in the Agbogbloshie market with a full array of locally made ovens, stoves and smokers, which are used every day to make the majority of palm nut soups, of tea and sugar breads, of grilled tilapia in the city."

And if we'd stopped there and flown home, which would have been the eminently sensible thing to do, then my talk would end here and it would end something like this."

Step five: I believe the Taliban have one of the most effective means of propaganda.
Their videos that they use are intercut with photographs of men and women and children dying in Iraq and Afghanistan and in Pakistan."	And the basic message is that the Western powers do not care about civilian deaths, so those people who live in areas and support governments that work with Western powers are fair game.	1
699#16	"The United States has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women.

So bats are also important for our health, to enable us to better understand how our genome functions.

But then, a lot of people think there are things that should have been in the original package that weren't agreed back then that should now be included, like sustainable development targets, natural resource governance targets, access to opportunity, to knowledge, equity, fighting corruption."

And so what I have felt -- and I have looked at this from a national security issue -- when I was Secretary of State, I decided that women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy, not just because I'm a feminist, but because I believe that societies are better off when women are politically and economically empowered, that values are passed down, the health situation is better, education is better, there is greater economic prosperity.	1

538#416	"But in fact, this is the little-known fact that I didn't realize at the time: Deforestation accounts for more greenhouse gas than all of the world's planes, trains, cars, trucks and ships combined.
It's the second highest contributor to climate change.
Also, according to Interpol, as much as 90 percent of the logging that takes place in the rainforest is illegal logging, like the illegal logging that we saw."	So if we can help people in the forest enforce the rules that are there, then in fact we could eat heavily into this 17 percent and potentially have a major impact in the short term.	1

So, we wondered: Can we do anything useful with this capacity to control metabolic flexibility?
And one of the things we wondered -- I'm sure some of you out there are economists, and you know all about supply and demand."	And when supply is equal to demand, everything's fine, but when supply falls, in this case of oxygen, and demand stays high, you're dead.	1

Traditional imaging satellites use a line scanner, similar to a Xerox machine, and as they traverse the Earth, they take pictures, scanning row by row by row to build the complete image."

"""And what you're looking at is a paper form in the hand of a Ministry of Health nurse in Indonesia, who is tramping out across the countryside in Indonesia on, I'm sure, a very hot and humid day, and she is going to be knocking on thousands of doors over a period of weeks or months, knocking on the doors and saying, """"Excuse me, we'd like to ask you some questions."""	1
780#72	"So I'm going to play you a couple of those.

808#16	"Because in the mid-1950s, when I was a tiny child, they had the audacity to launch a very primitive little satellite called Sputnik, which sent the Western world into a hysterical tailspin.
And a tremendous amount of money went into the funding of science and mathematics skills for kids.
And I'm a product of that generation, like so many other of my peers."	It really caught hold of us, and caught fire, and it would be lovely if we could reproduce that again now.	1
1218#40	"I was almost put on a special needs track as a child.
A month into kindergarten, my teacher wrote a page-long memo noting that I was impulsive, had a short attention span, and despite my wonderful curiosity, I was exhausting to work with.
The principal asked my parents into a meeting, asked my mother if there had been complications at birth and suggested I meet with a school psychologist."	My father saw what was happening and quickly explained our family situation.	1
1168#66	"Well, I'm an American, so I certainly don't hate myself, sometimes.
I'm an oppressed woman.
I'm way too stubborn for that."	You can ask my poor parents; they deal with it every day.	1
1336#97	"And I know there are good people out there.
I saw thousands of you in the streets, protesting family separation.
And that largely helped bring about an end to the official policy."	But we know that the government is still separating children.	1

549#338	"It turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure.
And it is this: Law sets boundaries, and on one side of those boundaries are all the things you can't do or must do -- you can't steal, you've got to pay your taxes -- but those same boundaries are supposed to define and protect a dry ground of freedom.
""Isaiah Berlin put it this way: """"Law sets frontiers, not artificially drawn, within which men shall be inviolable."""""""	We've forgotten that second part.	1
1070#202	"So figuring out all these relationships with relative and absolute location, distance, timing, velocities -- that's really the key to the science of moving dots, or as we like to call it, spatiotemporal pattern recognition, in academic vernacular.
Because the first thing is, you have to make it sound hard -- because it is.
The key thing is, for NBA coaches, it's not that they want to know whether a pick-and-roll happened or not."	It's that they want to know how it happened.	1
862#60	"The 14 girls decided to end their suffering by drinking the poison.
Before the poison took full effect, they were discovered by ISIS and taken to the hospital, where they survived.
ISIS decided to separate the girls and sell them individually."	Ayda was taken to another house and brutally raped after she attempted again to kill herself with her headscarf.	1
1206#356	"And you can see certain biases that come up again and again.
I'll give you four.

902#258	"All of us, you know?
If you remember back in US history, African-Americans were told they couldn’t join the military, and now they serve.

You don't need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it.

1316#280	"As the country got more well-off, unemployment actually rose and people's satisfaction with things like housing and education plummeted.
But it wasn't just anger at economic injustice.
It was also people's deep longing for freedom."	Contrary to the clash of civilizations theory, Arabs didn't despise Western liberty, they desired it.	1
1707#195	"They set people off.
They're incendiary and they do not allow us to find common ground.
They do not allow us to find a common heart."	And so to this point, when John McCain died in 2018, his supporters noted that he never made personal attacks.	1

1392#438	"Isolation, which is tied to depression, is another memory thief.
A study by the Harvard School of Public Health found that older people with high levels of social integration had a slower rate of memory decline over a six-year period.
The exact reason remains unclear, but experts suspect that social interaction gives our brain a mental workout."	Just like muscle strength, we have to use our brain or risk losing it.	1
1773#106	"And so, as a child, I saw jam disappear from the breakfast table, then margarine disappeared, then bread became too expensive, then milk became rationed.
And most of all, a kind of normalized political fear invaded our lives.

1977#437	"A great editor saves a writer from her excesses.
Copy editors, too, have a code; we don't advertise our oversights.
I feel disloyal divulging them here, so let's have look at what we do right."	Somehow, I've gotten a reputation for sternness.	1
46#275	"Perhaps it's no surprise that in a 2007 Pew survey, when surveyed, Africans in 10 countries said they thought that the Chinese were doing amazing things to improve their livelihoods by wide margins, by as much as 98 percent.
Finally, China is also providing innovative solutions to age-old social problems that the world faces.
If you travel to Mogadishu, Mexico City or Mumbai, you find that dilapidated infrastructure and logistics continue to be a stumbling block to the delivery of medicine and healthcare in the rural areas."	However, through a network of state-owned enterprises, the Chinese have been able to go into these rural areas, using their companies to help deliver on these healthcare solutions.	1
1527#113	"Because what it pays attention to is what it's seeing and interacting with, and what you're understanding what it's doing.
So in the videos I'm about to show you, you're going to see a visual attention system on a robot which has -- it looks for skin tone in HSV space, so it works across all human colorings.
It looks for highly saturated colors, from toys."	And it looks for things that move around.	1
1232#232	"They feel that they've actually gained what they never had, that their face now reflects their personality.
And actually that's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery and this kind of surgery.

1217#89	"I suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist.
It is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version of how to make another copy of you.
It's your blueprint."	It's composed of four subunits: A, C, G and T, we call them.	1
509#169	"We started in 2004.
You might have noticed, we haven't done all that well so far.
Nor do I think we are by ourselves, actually going to solve the problem."	But the more that I think about it, the more that I think that a few things that we have learned along the way are interesting lessons for how we would rewire if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world.	1
495#52	"I wouldn't have qualified as transgender.
If my family, though, had been the kind of people to believe in therapy, they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty.
But in my particular case, I just woke up one day when I was 14, and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again."	Puberty had hit, and I had no idea what being a girl meant, and I was ready to figure out who I actually was.	1
201#188	"And at the same time, we're growing more animals, and those animals are contributing food to humans as well.
So what we see is that that animal-human interface is becoming closer and closer together.
And this intensive agriculture of animals and this intensive increase in human populations living together on the same planet is really a melting pot where outbreaks can occur and do occur."	We will eventually have more and more of these outbreaks.	1
972#85	"And the Volvo is doing quite fine.
This is the war.
The Toyota got off track, and now the Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden -- can you see that?"	And they are taking over Sweden, and they are now healthier than Sweden.	1
1630#182	"So very simple robots, but they could be programmed to exhibit collective intelligence, and that's what we were able to do.
So this is what a single robot looks like.
It's quite small, about the size of a quarter, and you can program how it moves, but it can also wirelessly communicate with other robots, and it can measure distances from them."	And so now we can start to program exactly an interaction, a rule of engagement between neighbors.	1
1736#164	"You know, one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade.
The next minute they're on the same side.
Suddenly, Lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he's resented."	Could it be so simple though?	1
425#28	"These are sketches of some of the little details.
Rome is a city full of surprises.
I mean, we're talking about unusual perspectives, we're talking about narrow little winding streets that suddenly open into vast, sun-drenched piazzas -- never, though, piazzas that are not humanly scaled."	Part of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organically.	1
457#190	"So people like to share, if you give them the opportunity and the choice.
And the reason that I got obsessed with this, besides the obvious family aspects, is that I spend a lot of time around mathematicians, and mathematicians are drawn to places where there's a lot of data because they can use it to tease signals out of noise.
And those correlations that they can tease out, they're not necessarily causal agents, but math, in this day and age, is like a giant set of power tools that we're leaving on the floor, not plugged in in health, while we use hand saws."	If we have a lot of shared genotypes, and a lot of shared outcomes, and a lot of shared lifestyle choices, and a lot of shared environmental information, we can start to tease out the correlations between subtle variations in people, the choices they make and the health that they create as a result of those choices, and there's open-source infrastructure to do all of this.	1
1180#124	"Every one of them becomes a louder and louder voice, but they don't represent us.
They don't represent what our views are.
And that gets me back to the dollar, and it gets me back to reminding myself that we know this experience."	We know what it's like to have these people on TV, in Congress, yelling about how the end of the world is coming if we don't adopt their view completely, because it's happened about the dollar ever since there's been a dollar.	1
328#220	"But they don't go far enough, because they make people jump through hoops.
They have to come on the right days, at the right times.
They might have to have extra food to share."	They want to read away their fines, they need to be literate.	1
1872#16	"We have to end this.
And speaking out against the policies and the politics that divide us and diminish our collective power as a global community of women, and the men and the allies who stand with us.
Becoming dangerous also means embracing whatever risks are necessary to create a world where women and girls are safe in their homes and at work, where all voices are represented and respected, all votes counted, the planet protected."	And this is all possible.	1
2#94	"This universal hacker movement needs no introduction today, but six years ago they were not much more than an Internet subculture dedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats and Internet trolling campaigns.
Their moment of transformation was in early 2008 when the Church of Scientology attempted to remove certain leaked videos from appearing on certain websites.
This is when Anonymous was forged out of the seemingly random collection of Internet dwellers."	It turns out, the Internet doesn't like it when you try to remove things from it, and it will react with cyberattacks and elaborate pranks and with a series of organized protests all around the world, from my hometown of Tel Aviv to Adelaide, Australia.	1
1848#70	"We're now beginning to take thousands of features that people like you have found and we're sharing them with archaeologists who work in Peru.

Learning to control one of the most elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment in any child's personal history.

So what Sudhir eventually realized as he hung out with them more, is that, really, they didn't own those cars -- they just leased them, because they couldn't afford to own the fancy cars.
And they didn't really have gold jewelry, they had gold-plated jewelry."	It goes back to, you know, the real-real versus the fake-real.	1
544#246	"But I think that's an Orwellian way of describing black holes.

But I think when it comes to love, we are too willing to accept the short version of the story.
""The version of the story that asks, """"Are you still together?"""""""	and is content with a yes or no answer.	1

Around 1850, one of the biggest U.S. industries was whaling.
And whale oil lit practically every building."	But in the nine years before Drake struck oil, in 1859, at least five-sixths of that whale oil-illuminating market disappeared, thanks to fatal competitors, chiefly oil and gas made from coal, to which the whalers had not been paying attention.	1

Now, we don't fully have a picture of what this will look like yet, but we're seeing pockets of evolution emerging all around us -- maybe not even evolution, I'd even start to call it a revolution -- in the way that we govern."	Some of it's very high-tech, and some of it is extremely low-tech, such as the project that MKSS is running in Rajasthan, India, where they take the spending data of the state and paint it on 100,000 village walls, and then invite the villagers to come and comment who is on the government payroll, who's actually died, what are the bridges that have been built to nowhere, and to work together through civic engagement to save real money and participate and have access to that budget.	1
2161#339	"And I claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system, which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions.
So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group, say the use of fire, or a particular type of tool, instead of dying out, this spread rapidly, horizontally across the population, or was transmitted vertically, down the generations.
So, this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian, instead of Darwinian."	Darwinian evolution is slow; it takes hundreds of thousands of years.	1
211#364	"Well psychology actually says there is a tension -- a tension between self-regarding behaviors and other regarding behaviors.
And these tensions have deep evolutionary roots, so selfish behavior is adaptive in certain circumstances -- fight or flight.

On the one hand, we can choose between a new golden age where information is more universally available than it's ever been in human history, where we all have the answers to our questions at our fingertips.
And on the other hand, we have the potential to be living in some gloomy dystopia where the machines have taken over and we've all decided it's not important what we know anymore, that knowledge isn't valuable because it's all out there in the cloud, and why would we ever bother learning anything new."

Now, if the number of connections that we can make is proportional to the number of pairs of data points, a hundredfold multiplication in the quantity of data is a ten-thousandfold multiplication in the number of patterns that we can see in that data, this just in the last 10 or 11 years.	1

Different ant species must use different algorithms, because they've evolved to deal with different resources, and it could be really useful to know about this, and so we recently asked ants to solve the collective search problem in the extreme environment of microgravity in the International Space Station.
When I first saw this picture, I thought, Oh no, they've mounted the habitat vertically, but then I realized that, of course, it doesn't matter."	So the idea here is that the ants are working so hard to hang on to the wall or the floor or whatever you call it that they're less likely to interact, and so the relationship between how crowded they are and how often they meet would be messed up.	1

Yet, as has become strikingly clear over the last couple of years, such responsibility has to a very great extent been abrogated by large sections of the media.

Our conscious mind only controls about 5% of our cognitive function, including communication, while the other 95% occurs beyond our awareness, and according to the literature on reality monitoring, stories based on imagined experiences are qualitatively different from those based on real experiences.	1

Regarding a prince’s personal behavior, Machiavelli advises keeping up the appearance of virtues such as honesty or generosity, but being ready to abandon them as soon as one’s interests are threatened.	1

That is a lot of deaths, and yet, the chances are good that you don't feel at risk, that you imagine these people were hospital patients in intensive care units or nursing home residents near the ends of their lives, people whose infections are remote from us, in situations we can't identify with.	1

It all begins in the brain.
The hypothalamus, the master controller of your hormones, releases something called corticotropin-releasing hormone."

It's expensive, complicated and confusing.

977#408	"By the way, I find -- Homer Groening's film presented a beautiful alternative to that very claim.
Yes, there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong.
We don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us."	But that, as I said, is just a difference of opinion.	1
1274#103	"And I mentioned I'll use some visual representations of sounds.
Here's the first example.
This is a plot of frequency against time -- sort of like musical notation, where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower, and time goes this way."

It's the same thing here."	We can't predict any particular project, but the result of this whole worldwide, chaotic, unpredictable activity of competition and the evolutionary process of technology is very predictable.	1
1607#113	"OK, in the negative time I have left, I'll tell you about the most recent --  invention from our lab.
It's called Abuzz -- the idea that all of you could help us fight mosquitoes; you could all help us track our enemies.
These are enemies because they cause malaria, Zika, chikungunya, dengue."	But the challenge is that we actually don't know where our enemies are.	1
678#267	"While I'm an artist, I'm also a scientist, and I direct a laboratory that researches nanotechnology, which is the science of building things with ultratiny building blocks, thousands of times smaller even than the width of a human hair.
And I began to ask myself, how could nanotechnology serve tattooing?
If tattoos are just a bunch of particles in the skin, could we swap those particles out for ones that do something more interesting?"	Here's my big idea: I believe that tattoos can give you superpowers.	1

If the robot appears with the left lever already pulled down, or if an individual has previously pulled the left lever down at any point in the past, then they should move the right lever.

I also think that more generally, the use of the Internet and technology as a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general trend.
It is a -- sort of a great human progress."	Technology is just generally being used to allow us to create in as shared and social a way as possible.	1
2036#335	"The message of harm reduction is that while drugs can hurt you, we still must reach out to people who are addicted.
A needle exchange is not an advertisement for drug use.
Neither is a methadone clinic or a supervised injection site."	What you see there are people sick and hurting, hardly an endorsement for drug use.	1
265#429	"You carve them in blocks and then you pile them on top of one another, and they support weight.
So there has to be function, the function has to be predictable and the cost has to be low.

Well, I can tell you as a conductor, I work with orchestras around the world all the time, and I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of disabled musicians I've encountered in any orchestra, anywhere.
Why is this?"	You can't tell me that there aren't millions upon millions of prodigiously gifted musicians of disability around the world.	1
1815#297	"It turns out that some kids just love harassing robots.
So besides dystopia, Hollywood also promised us some really cool robots that would run our errands or keep us company.
So far, we've really focused on food delivery, but in the future, these robots can do more."	Like, they could gather excess food and bring it to shelters every night.	1
2069#50	"What makes it even more frustrating is that the data-entry part, the part that I used to do as a grad student, can take sometimes six months.

1884#167	"I'd go further.
A responsible filmmaker should never devalue their work to a point at which it becomes less than true to the world they themselves wish to inhabit.
As I see it, filmmakers, journalists, even bloggers are all required to face up to the social expectations that come with combining the intrinsic power of their medium with their well-honed professional skills."	Obviously this is not a mandated duty, but for the gifted filmmaker and the responsible journalist or even blogger, it strikes me as being utterly inescapable.	1

559#101	"And then, here's how the crash test works.
Here, they don't actually crash the entire car, you know -- it's not worth ruining a whole car to do it.
So they just have these bench seats, and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it."	So I just wanted you to look at this.	1
1724#445	"But in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient.
This is, the kids will feel the therapeutic object needs him.

1034#127	"So there are two options: intelligent design, direct and indirect -- so God, or my friend.
Now talking about E.T. putting us there, or some other life, just pushes the problem further on.

They tend to prefer the puppet who has the same food tastes that they have, and worse, they actually prefer puppets who punish the puppet with the different food taste.

TKM: So what does it mean to reconceptualize sex away from this idea of the monster hiding in the night?

Now in learning from the past and sliding into the present, a radical theory of sex must identify, it must describe, explain and denounce sexual oppression and erotic injustice.	1
1546#109	"It leads you to freeze.
But idea doubt is energizing.
It motivates you to test, to experiment, to refine, just like MLK did."	And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap from step three to step four.	1
1459#170	"In the story I'm going to tell you, our conscious experiences of the world around us, and of ourselves within it, are kinds of controlled hallucinations that happen with, through and because of our living bodies.
Now, you might have heard that we know nothing about how the brain and body give rise to consciousness.
Some people even say it's beyond the reach of science altogether."	But in fact, the last 25 years have seen an explosion of scientific work in this area.	1
1417#52	"And it's pretty amazing actually.
Then you notice that if that LEGO-provided CAD program isn't enough, there's an entire open-source, third-party, independent LEGO CAD program that lets you do 3D modeling and 3D rendering and make, in fact, movies out of LEGO, 3D films of which there are thousands on YouTube, and some of them sort of mimicking famous films and some totally original content -- just beautiful -- and people recreating all sorts of things.

96#34	"That job is done in part by proteins like these.
These donut-shaped proteins, of which there are many types in the cell, all seem to act to rip apart structures by basically pulling individual proteins through a central hole.
When these kinds of proteins don't work properly, the types of proteins that are supposed to get taken apart can sometimes stick together and aggregate and that can give rise to terrible diseases, such as Alzheimer's."	And now let's take a look at the nucleus, which houses our genome in the form of DNA.	1
237#37	"KS: Now, we showed the concept to a few people before this, and they asked us, when's it coming out?
So I just wanted to let you know, it's not actually coming out, just the concept is.

What happened, actually, when Dunbar looked at the tape, is that, in fact, almost all of the important breakthrough ideas did not happen alone in the lab, in front of the microscope."	They happened at the conference table at the weekly lab meeting, when everybody got together and shared their latest data and findings, oftentimes when people shared the mistakes they were having, the error, the noise in the signal they were discovering.	1

We can save the lives of people who are at high risk for a heart attack.
What is the response to acute myocardial infarction, a heart attack, today?"	Well, you feel some chest pain or indigestion.	1
1403#28	"But how did we actually implement this?
Well, we started within the walls of our school classroom.
Instead of simply explaining menstruation to children from a textbook or biological standpoint, we adopted an innovative approach."	We conducted an activity where students strung together a bracelet consisting of 28 beads signifying the length of the menstrual cycle, out of which four to seven beads were of a different color, demonstrating the days a woman bleeds.	1
90#101	"And it make sense.
It's such a unique perspective.
Nothing really communicates this scale, for example, in context, in a way that this does."	But there are a few hurdles, and they are quite basic and quite fundamental.	1
44#350	"Nothing happened except that I got jaundiced from one of these things.
And finally, because I was well-known in Connecticut, they decided they better have a meeting of the senior staff.
All the senior staff got together, and I later found out what happened."	They put all their heads together, and they decided that there was nothing that could be done for this surgeon who had essentially separated himself from the world, who by that time had become so overwhelmed, not just with depression and feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy, but with obsessional thinking, obsessional thinking about coincidences.	1
1591#408	"Most people say they would.
They can't imagine buying it for twice the price when, with one trip across town, they can get it for half off.
Now, let's imagine instead you wanted to buy a car that had a stereo, and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000."	But if you drove across town, you could get it for 30,900.	1
364#151	"One of the ways in which we would like to deal with the sophistication of the modern world is through politics, and sadly you can have humane moral principles, you can classify, you can use logic on abstractions, and if you're ignorant of history and of other countries, you can't do politics.
We've noticed, in a trend among young Americans, that they read less history and less literature and less material about foreign lands, and they're essentially ahistorical.
They live in the bubble of the present."	They don't know the Korean War from the war in Vietnam.	1
830#22	"And this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
So lots of levels of testosterone, but no reaction to it.
As a consequence, the body develops more along the female typical path."	When the child is born, she looks like a girl.	1
1077#45	"So they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments.
In fact, QQ.com, which is a popular Chinese website, had 35,000 comments on this issue within hours.

Cancer is a very clever disease.
There are some forms of cancer, which, fortunately, we've learned how to address relatively well with known and established drugs and surgery."	But there are some forms of cancer that don't respond to these approaches, and the tumor survives or comes back, even after an onslaught of drugs.	1
1318#175	"Now, all of this is a little hard to imagine, so let me just show you what I am talking about.
Those computer models I mentioned allow us to test these ideas, so let's take a look at one of them.
This movie, made by my research group, shows us what happened to the universe after its earliest moments."	You see the universe started out pretty smooth, but there were some regions where there was a little bit more material.	1
179#174	"And I remember exactly where I was about a week and a half later.
I was sitting in the back of my used minivan in a campus parking lot, when I decided I was going to commit suicide.
I went from deciding to full-blown planning very quickly."	And I came this close to the edge of the precipice.	1
1310#365	"Then static electricity set in.
And it went ...

I showed here two years ago a little bit about a design of your basic, uncompromised, quintupled-efficiency suburban-assault vehicle --  -- and this is a complete virtual design that is production-costed manufacturable.
And the process needed to make it is actually coming toward the market quite nicely."	We figured out a kind of a digital inkjet printer for this very stiff, strong, carbon-composite material, and then ways to thermoform it, because it's a combination of carbon and nylon, into whatever complex shapes you want, like the one just shown at the auto show by one of the tier-one suppliers.	1
1989#654	"That’s 395 million times colder than your refrigerator, 100 million times colder than liquid nitrogen, and 4 million times colder than outer space.
Temperatures this low give scientists a window into the inner workings of matter, and allow engineers to build incredibly sensitive instruments that tell us more about everything from our exact position on the planet to what’s happening in the farthest reaches of the universe.
How do we create such extreme temperatures?"	In short, by slowing down moving particles.	1
1859#13	"I decided to meet other people like me and find that out.
The best place to meet a lot of polyglots is an event where hundreds of language lovers meet in one place to practice their languages.
There are several such polyglot events organized all around the world, and so I decided to go there and ask polyglots about the methods that they use."	And so I met Benny from Ireland, who told me that his method is to start speaking from day one.	1
1345#59	"All right, well first of all, I'mma say, you know what I'm saying, I'm the only dude up here right now.

882#87	"This little space became a small phenomenon, and because it had such a profound impact on New Yorkers, it made an enormous impression on me.
I studied this park very early on in my career because it happened to have been built by my stepfather, so I knew that places like Paley Park didn't happen by accident.
I saw firsthand that they required incredible dedication and enormous attention to detail."	But what was it about this space that made it special and drew people to it?	1
784#189	"And don't you want to?
I want to see what the other 51 percent of the population has to say.

238#158	"And then this bizarre thing happened.
Those of us who used to be very depressed for a long time, we started to feel less depressed, whereas the newcomers, they were so not used to feeling this way that they were now even more depressed.
So you could see writers from Bangladesh or Turkey or Egypt trying to console their colleagues from Brexit Britain or from post-election USA."	But joking aside, I think our world is full of unprecedented challenges, and this comes with an emotional backlash, because in the face of high-speed change, many people wish to slow down, and when there's too much unfamiliarity, people long for the familiar.	1
324#500	"Brian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try and actually discover all the species on Earth.
And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects, just to see what's on life.
And if we did that with our little Martian probe, which we have not done on Earth, we would begin to see some incredible species."	This is not on another planet.	1
965#173	"It took about altogether just two hours, pretty much, to create the simulation.
And that's what it looks like, here.
Now, this could do with a bit more work."	It's still very early stages, and we pretty much just did this for a laugh, just to see what we'd get out of it.	1
94#66	"And giving talks is a part of it.
And the arrangers always put out a glass of water for you onstage so you have something to drink if you get thirsty, and I always so badly want to drink that water, but I don't dare to pick the glass up because then people might be able to see that my hands are shaking.

82#232	"Those are the things that often tend to help the most, especially when combined with psychopharmaceuticals.
The thing, though, I believe, that helps the most, particularly with social animals, is time with other social animals.
In many ways, I feel like I became a service animal to my own dog, and I have seen parrots do it for people and people do it for parrots and dogs do it for elephants and elephants do it for other elephants."	I don't know about you; I get a lot of Internet forwards of unlikely animal friendships.	1

Its author was a man named Hans Asperger, who ran a combination clinic and residential school in Vienna in the 1930s.
Asperger's ideas about teaching children with learning differences were progressive even by contemporary standards."	Mornings at his clinic began with exercise classes set to music, and the children put on plays on Sunday afternoons.	1
1101#1089	"And that's kind of the point.
Because, you know, resilience -- if you think of it in terms of the Gold Rush, then you'd be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be gone.
But the good thing is, with innovation, there isn't a last nugget."	Every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities.	1
232#132	"We put the question of what it means to be normal versus sick back on the spectrum of the human condition.
And it is on that spectrum where we can all connect and seek healing together, for all of our struggles with humanness.

1970#40	"And all the men have these poison arrows that they use for hunting -- absolutely fatal.
So how do they deal with their differences?
Well, what I learned is, whenever tempers rise in those communities, someone goes and hides the poison arrows out in the bush, and then everyone sits around in a circle like this, and they sit and they talk and they talk."	It may take two days, three days, four days, but they don't rest until they find a resolution or better yet -- a reconciliation.	1
1511#201	"Sure enough, I had caught one, I just completely forgot.
So this one, we decided to give the name Centropyge narcosis to.

280#397	"So just because I'm talking about the exteriors of buildings, not form, not function, not structure, even so those surfaces give texture to our lives, because buildings create the spaces around them, and those spaces can draw people in or push them away.
And the difference often has to do with the quality of those exteriors.
So one contemporary equivalent of the Plaza Mayor in Salamanca is the Place de la Défense in Paris, a windswept, glass-walled open space that office workers hurry through on the way from the metro to their cubicles but otherwise spend as little time in as possible."	In the early 1980s, the architect Philip Johnson tried to recreate a gracious European plaza in Pittsburgh.	1
402#307	"After printing, some bioinks will stiffen immediately; others need UV light or an additional chemical or physical process to stabilize the structure.
If the printing process is successful, the cells in the synthetic tissue will begin to behave the same way cells do in real tissue: signaling to each other, exchanging nutrients, and multiplying.
We can already print relatively simple structures like this meniscus."	Bioprinted bladders have also been successfully implanted, and printed tissue has promoted facial nerve regeneration in rats.	1
721#403	"And now the administration is proposing to roll back a lot of the progress we've made in the past 20 years.

2141#123	"Using feathers from the flocks that perched on the tower, and the wax from candles, Daedalus constructed two pairs of giant wings.
As he strapped the wings to his son Icarus, he gave a warning: flying too near the ocean would dampen the wings and make them too heavy to use.
Flying too near the sun, the heat would melt the wax and the wings would disintegrate."	In either case, they surely would die.	1

1355#126	"So when you measure those teeth, it was clear that she turned out to be a girl with very small canine teeth.
And to know how old she was when she died, what you do is you do an informed estimate, and you say, how much time would be required to form this amount of teeth, and the answer was three.
So, this girl died when she was about three, 3.3 million years ago."	So, with all that information, the big question is -- what do we actually -- what does she tell us?	1

We don't like them, but it's a strong indicator of a negative emotion.

And one of the ways I like to do that is to look back at the stories people used to tell before we had cheap oil, before we had fossil fuels, and people relied on their own muscle, animal muscle energy, or a little bit of wind, little bit of water energy.	1
335#28	"But you know what, Mr. Randolph would turn out to be my greatest advocate.
But in the beginning, oh, I made sure he knew I did not like him.

There have been many episodes, and actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience, but in two instances, his great-grandfather, grandfather -- I'm always a little perplexed about the relation, exactly -- Charles Eames the first time and then Charles and Ray Eames the second time were involved in two competitions: one in 1940, it was about organic furniture, and the second one in 1948 was low-cost furniture for the GIs coming back from the war that then sparked a whole line of furniture.
And then there was good design for very low price."	There were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life.	1
1713#309	"Another final motivation is that panpsychism might help us to integrate consciousness into the physical world.
Physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a bunch of equations, but it doesn't tell us about the reality that underlies it."	As Stephen Hawking puts it, what puts the fire into the equations?	1
496#58	"It's a death sentence.
The expected five year survival is less than five percent.

Now even after all of this granular level of control, do futureless language speakers seem to save more?
Yes, futureless language speakers, even after this level of control, are 30 percent more likely to report having saved in any given year."	Does this have cumulative effects?	1

So that was the 20th century."	Now here -- and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon -- there is good news, amazing news, in the 21st century, and that is that, almost out of nowhere, there has come into being an anti-genocide movement, an anti-genocide constituency, and one that looks destined, in fact, to be permanent.	1

But ultimately, both his belief in collaboration with the government and his membership to the communist party had been driven by his desire to maximize tangible gains in liberties for black Americans, and to do so as quickly as possible."	Rustin was passed over for several influential roles in the 1960s and 70s, but he never stopped his activism.	1
950#21	"About a year ago, our security researchers were tracking a somewhat ordinary but sophisticated banking Trojan called the Dyre Wolf.
The Dyre Wolf would get on your computer via you clicking on a link in a phishing email that you probably shouldn't have.
It would then sit and wait."	It would wait until you logged into your bank account.	1

Then when I moved  Miami, I noticed HIV included women and children, primarily, poor black and brown people.
Within a few years, an infection seen in a select population became a worldwide epidemic."	Again I got the urge to do something.	1
1713#86	"And that, obviously, is a problem.
We now have a whole underground marketplace and business ecosystem built around online crime.
One example of how these guys actually are capable of monetizing their operations: we go and have a look at the pages of INTERPOL and search for wanted persons."	We find guys like Bjorn Sundin, originally from Sweden, and his partner in crime, also listed on the INTERPOL wanted pages, Mr. Shaileshkumar Jain, a U.S. citizen.	1
104#92	"The body is political.
If our breastfeeding support is not intersectional, it's not good enough.
And for moms who have to return for work, because countries like the United States do not provide paid parental leave, they can have to go back in as short as just a few days after giving birth."	How do we optimize mother and infant health just by messaging about breast milk to moms without providing the institutional support that facilitates that mother-infant bonding to support breastfeeding?	1
2188#277	"Now, this is a real hospital, in a real emergency room.
One of the reasons he chose to take this rather large video camera with him was because he didn’t want the doctors and nurses thinking he was actually sick, and sticking something into him that he was going to regret later.
So anyhow, he went there with his video camera, and it’s kind of interesting to see what he brought back."	Because when we looked at the video when he got back, we saw 20 minutes of this.	1

We put that proposition to the meeting, two seconds, and then the room exploded.
I have never, ever experienced anything like that in my life."	And it's been the same in every single room, in every town that we've ever told our story.	1
831#455	"I have dropped a blob of organic yogurt from happy self-actualized local cows on my counter top, and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up.

89#73	"It turns out that driving, with its associated design implementation and regulatory hurdles, is actually a harder problem to solve than flying.
For those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground, this may be counter-intuitive, but driving has potholes, cobblestones, pedestrians, other drivers and a rather long and detailed list of federal motor vehicle safety standards to contend with.
Fortunately, necessity remains the mother of invention, and a lot of the design work that we're the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continuously-variable transmission and liquid-based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop-and-go traffic, to a custom-designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you're flying or the wheels on the ground, to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we'll see in a moment, to crash safety features."	We have a carbon fiber safety cage that protects the occupants for less than 10 percent of the weight of a traditional steel chassis in a car.	1

439#16	"Eratosthenes was the third librarian at the great Library of Alexandria, and he made many contributions to science.
But the one he is most remembered for began in a letter that he received as the librarian, from the town of Swenet, which was south of Alexandria.
The letter included this fact that stuck in Eratosthenes' mind, and the fact was that the writer said, at noon on the solstice, when he looked down this deep well, he could see his reflection at the bottom, and he could also see that his head was blocking the sun."	I should tell you -- the idea that Christopher Columbus discovered that the world is spherical is total bull.	1

As of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization, has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems and has seen their yields and incomes double or triple on average, but this didn't happen overnight.
In fact, when you go back to the beginning, there were no private investors who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology for a market class that made under a dollar a day, that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture."	And so we needed grants.	1

1214#22	"But it's not insurmountable.
We can shift this narrative.
Let's start with some data."	According to a National Black Women's Justice Institute analysis of civil rights data collected by the US Department of Education, black girls are the only group of girls who are overrepresented along the entire continuum of discipline in schools.	1

1881#160	"For hours afterwards, the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around -- all of this was from the houses in the slum.
When the waters subsided, it was as if it had never existed.
This may seem hard to believe -- unless you've been reading lots and lots of news reports -- but in many places, after the tsunami, villagers were still terrified."	When what was a tranquil sea swallows up people, homes and long-tail boats -- mercilessly, without warning -- and no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming, I'm not sure you'd want to calm down either.	1

The only piece of evidence is two very faint, overlapping fingerprints on the tape that was found wrapped around Katie's neck.

1989#397	"All that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water, also helps cool our cities.
Because, come to think about it, do you really want air-conditioning, or is it a cooler room that you want?

164#279	"And he used three fundamental principles.
The first one was miniaturization.
The drip irrigation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quarter acre, even if he had two, because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake."	Second, it had to be extremely affordable.	1
1265#130	"Number two: free trade.
Number three: property rights.
Number four: rule of law."	Number five: entrepreneurship.	1
1455#43	"It's a pretty strong incentive to leave them at home, right?

And I think it's pretty likely that the invasive species, the ones that come into our buildings, are going to be really good at this, because they're in your kitchen because they're really good at finding food and water.
So the most familiar resource for ants is a picnic, and this is a clustered resource."	When there's one piece of fruit, there's likely to be another piece of fruit nearby, and the ants that specialize on clustered resources use interactions for recruitment.	1
1127#61	"But the fifth world still wasn’t truly established.
Nanahuatl, Lord Sun, shined for four days straight without moving through the sky like all the previous suns had moved.
Back in their home, Teotihuacan, the gods began to worry."	They sent Obsidian Hawk up to ask what was wrong.	1
879#70	"And then there's social media.
I can imagine some pretty frickin' dystopian scenarios where things like internet quizzes, dating apps, horoscopes, bots, all combine to drag you down deeper and deeper rabbit holes into bad relationships and worse politics.
But then I think about the conversations that I've had with people who work on AI, and what I always hear from them is that the smarter AI gets, the better it is at making connections."	So maybe the social media of the future will be better.	1
1141#277	"The whole thing kind of collapses into this collaborative train wreck.
And everybody leaves very angry.
It's kind of funny."	Let's take a quick look.	1

And when you're in the middle of the galaxies it's hard to see the pattern; it's like being in the middle of life.
It's hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience, it's hard to see the pattern of this."	So we're going to go out and swing around and look back at this.	1
1050#161	"Now, this is an area -- I mean, there is a treasure trove of wealth in the traditional medicine area.
This is where we need to mobilize Africans, in the Diaspora especially, to invest in this.

When the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter, she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go, even when they hold a gun to her head.
Somehow, the family survives for 16 months, and then, by extraordinary luck, and the passionate heart of a young American man, Sasha Chanoff, who manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane, Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix, Arizona, where they're now living and thriving."	Mapendo, in Swahili, means great love.	1
1984#60	"How is that?
Well, if I hold conservative values, for instance, I probably prefer big proper cars and small government over tiny, tiny cars and huge government.
And if climate science comes and then says government should expand further, then I probably will trust that science less."	In this way, cultural identity starts to override the facts.	1
1601#88	"You can start painting on any wall.
You stop by a wall, and start painting on that wall.
But we are not only tracking one finger, here."	We are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands, so you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out of a map just by pinching all present.	1

BG: So the beginning of the flight is actually you jump off a plane or a helicopter, and you go on a dive and accelerate the engines, and then you basically take off mid-air somewhere.	1
200#46	"It's called the bureaucratic administrative machine.
In order to have that machine running, you need lots and lots of people.

If you can charge people more for shorter periods of content, some distributor has figured out a way to make a lot more money.
If you're making content, it costs less money to make it and put it out there."	And, by the way, if you're 14 and have a short attention span, like my daughter, that's what you want to see, that's what you want to make, that's how it works.	1
1712#61	"And there are days when I still allow option one to take place because option two is just too hard or too risky.

Paleontology allowed me to combine my love for animals with my desire to travel to far-flung corners of the world.

Beyond the rarity and the dollar value -- and I'll be honest, we're totally obsessed by that -- the true beauty is to give art a second chance; to save art from oblivion.

And a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits of having lots of people look at problems, share the information and work on those things together.
So, a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time, and unless Lisa Randall changes that, we'll continue to move in linear time."	So that means anything you do, or anything you make, you produce a sequence of steps -- and I think Lego in the '70s nailed this, and they did it most elegantly.	1

A staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow genes from it when antibiotics come, and change and mutate.

The first thing you notice about the motion is that it repeats itself.
The cork traces the same path over and over again... up and down, up and down."	This repetitive or periodic motion is characteristic of waves.	1
1151#278	"How do you bring an intimacy into a hall?
Intimacy for us means a lot of different things.
It means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy."	One thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall.	1

We also found a lot of examples of dead big-box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community-serving uses as well -- lots of schools, lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one.
This was a little grocery store, a Food Lion grocery store, that is now a public library."	In addition to, I think, doing a beautiful adaptive reuse, they tore up some of the parking spaces, put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff, put in a lot more sidewalks to connect to the neighborhoods.	1

It is a curious way to design the ceiling, now starting out with God creating life, ending up with some guy blind drunk in a barn.

450#191	"""Things that they started doing themselves -- like changing the floor going into the patient's room so that it signified, """"This is my room.""
""This is my personal space"""" -- was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem.""
So you went from public space to private space."	And another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses -- which I love -- was they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards, then they put them on one wall of the patient's room, and they put this sticker there.	1
2034#49	"A study by Merritt Hawkins found that only 20 percent of the family doctors in Denver take any Medicaid patients.
And of those 20 percent, some have caps, like five Medicaid patients a month.
Others make Medicaid patients wait months to be seen, but will see you today, if you have Blue Cross."	This form of classist discrimination is legal and is not just a problem in Denver.	1
274#64	"One has to do with human genius and creativity.
The other has to do with human insatiability, or greed, if you like.
I'm going to call the first of these the O-ring principle, and it determines the type of work that we do."	The second principle is the never-get-enough principle, and it determines how many jobs there actually are.	1
812#46	"And why might we need a sustainable agriculture?
Well, actually, it is estimated that the population will reach about 10 billion by 2050, and we're projecting that we will need to increase food production by 70 percent.
In addition, we will need many more resources and raw materials to make consumer goods and industrial goods."	So how will we scale to meet that demand?	1
230#73	"I'm going to use a much smaller device, something like this one here.
So this is a small device, a small robot rover, that has a little scoop, and it brings the regolith to the dome and then it lays down a thin layer of regolith, and then you would have the robot that will solidify it, layer by layer, until it creates, after a few months, the full base.
You might have noticed that it's quite a particular structure that we're printing, and I've got a little example here."	What we call this is a closed-cell foam structure.	1
1259#184	"I mean, what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her?

If you censor one journalist, then it intimidates others, and soon nations are silenced."	It's important that we protect our journalists and freedom of the press, because that makes governments more accountable to us and more transparent.	1

Soon, we were able to align ourselves with partners who understood, because I understand the challenge.
Ultimately, you need to trust where your money's going, and that trust usually manifests through the requirement to create detailed plans -- lots of paperwork."

So what can we tell schools, teachers and parents who want to help support kids from disadvantaged backgrounds to do their best in school and in life?
Well, emerging science suggests that growing up in poverty is associated with a host of different experiences and that these experiences in turn may work together to help shape brain development and ultimately help kids learn."	And so if this is right, it begs the question: Where along this pathway can we step in and provide help?	1
1147#92	"Fourth, prototyping: gathering whatever you can, whatever you can find, to mimic your solution, to test it and to refine it.
And finally, implementation: ensuring that the solution you came up with is sustainable.
Warren Berger says that design thinking teaches us to look sideways, to reframe, to refine, to experiment and, probably most importantly, ask those stupid questions."	Design thinkers believe that everyone is creative.	1

Of the 55 that do graduate, two will remain unemployed, and another 18 are underemployed."	So, college grads earn more than high school grads, but does it pay for the exorbitant tuition and the lost wages while at college?	1

At the cellular level, estrogen literally pushes neurons to burn glucose to make energy.
If your estrogen is high, your brain energy is high."	When your estrogen declines though, your neurons start slowing down and age faster.	1
519#70	"We are hardwired for that negative.
We're really, really good at noticing them.
Negative emotions stick to us like Velcro, whereas positive emotions and experiences seems to bounce off like Teflon."	Being wired in this way is actually really good for us, and served us well from an evolutionary perspective.	1
1091#97	"One of them is the idea of linearity: that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right, you will end up set for the rest of your life.
Everybody who's spoken at TED has told us implicitly, or sometimes explicitly, a different story: that life is not linear; it's organic.
We create our lives symbiotically as we explore our talents in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us."	But, you know, we have become obsessed with this linear narrative.	1
1132#20	"Some of these are even visible, such as higher density of the grey matter that contains most of your brain's neurons and synapses, and more activity in certain regions when engaging a second language.
The heightened workout a bilingual brain receives throughout its life can also help delay the onset of diseases, like Alzheimer's and dementia by as much as five years.
The idea of major cognitive benefits to bilingualism may seem intuitive now, but it would have surprised earlier experts."	Before the 1960s, bilingualism was considered a handicap that slowed a child's development by forcing them to spend too much energy distinguishing between languages, a view based largely on flawed studies.	1

421#229	"That is where you come in.
What is certain is that the individual talent exhibited in such abundance here, needs to turn its attention to that collaborative, messy, frustrating, contentious and impossible world of politics and public policy.

2093#100	"She finally decided that she wasn't a virgin anymore after she'd had her first orgasm with a partner.
And I thought -- whoa.
What if just for a second we imagined that was the definition?"	Again, not because intercourse isn't a big deal -- of course it is -- but it isn't the only big deal, and rather than thinking about sex as a race to a goal, this helps us reconceptualize it as a pool of experiences that include warmth, affection, arousal, desire, touch, intimacy.	1

1868#216	"There's nothing dangerous about black people or any other racial group.
And so when we see these racial disparities all around us, we see them as abnormal, and then we start to figure out, OK, what policies are behind so many black people being killed by police?

839#225	"Companies in the West spend billions of dollars investing in R&amp;D, and use tons of natural resources to create ever more complex products, to differentiate their brands from competition, and they charge customers more money for new features.
So the conventional business model in the West is more for more.
But sadly, this more for more model is running out of gas, for three reasons: First, a big portion of customers in the West because of the diminishing purchasing power, can no longer afford these expensive products."	Second, we are running out of natural water and oil.	1

It's a long story, but the core idea is just that what you get from purely reductionist explanations in physical terms, in brain-based terms, is stories about the functioning of a system, its structure, its dynamics, the behavior it produces, great for solving the easy problems — how we behave, how we function — but when it comes to subjective experience — why does all this feel like something from the inside? — that's something fundamentally new, and it's always a further question.	1

Even after slavery was abolished, whites still gave more preferential treatment to blacks that had more Anglo-type features, giving them better access to jobs, housing and education."

And I was not existent before.
So apart from the shock of my mom discovering that she was a 3D printer, I immediately got mesmerized by that piece, the first one, the information."	What amount of information does it take to build and assemble a human?	1
2079#415	"This unification model predicts the existence of these two new force particles, which should act a lot like the weak force, only weaker.
Now, we can rotate this set of charges in seven dimensions and consider an odd fact about the matter particles: the second and third generations of matter have exactly the same charges in six-dimensional charge space as the first generation.
These particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges."	They sit on top of one another in the standard charge space.	1
346#371	"Second of all, if you don't have the feeling of play in you, you need to rediscover play.
Whatever it was that as a kid you used to enjoy, that you enjoyed only six months ago, but now that you've got that promotion you can't enjoy, because you feel like you have to be serious, rediscover it.
I don't care if it's mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game."	Rediscover that because you're the leaders, the innovation leaders, the thought leaders.	1

Back in Haiti, people were increasingly turning to the medium of SMS.
People that were hungry and hurting were signaling their distress, were signaling their need for help."	On street sides all over Port-au-Prince, entrepreneurs sprung up offering mobile phone charging stations.	1
1961#351	"The more I've seen and learned about our respective generations, the more I realize that we often don't trust each other enough to actually share our respective wisdom.
We may share a border, but we don't necessarily trust each other enough to share that respective wisdom.
I believe, looking at the modern workplace, that the trade agreement of our time is opening up these intergenerational pipelines of wisdom so that we can all learn from each other."	Almost 40 percent of us in the United States have a boss that's younger than us, and that number is growing quickly.	1
70#281	"And that's been going on since 2014.
And I accepted the commission with the idea that I would photograph three generations of women dealing with the crisis on a daily basis.

The race to create the hottest pepper is a constant battle, but two peppers generally come out on top: The Trinidad Moruga Scorpion and the Carolina Reaper.
These peppers measure between 1.5 and 2 million Scoville heat units, which is about half the units found in pepper spray."	So, why would anyone want to eat something that causes such high levels of pain?	1
641#73	"The daf-2 hormone receptor is very similar to the receptor for the hormone insulin and IGF-1.
Now you've all heard of at least insulin.
Insulin is a hormone that promotes the uptake of nutrients into your tissues after you eat a meal."	And the hormone IGF-1 promotes growth.	1
1033#198	"36,500 cracks later, both hands were arthritis-free.
For this selfless act of devotion to science, Dr. Unger received an Ig Nobel Prize, a parody of the Nobel Prize that recognizes wacky, but weirdly fascinating, scientific accomplishments.
Unger wrote that his results should prompt investigation into other parental beliefs, like the importance of eating spinach."	The jury's still out on that one.	1
1263#88	"I just, without a plan, I just reacted to little requests, not work requests, those I all said no to, but other little requests.

1125#185	"And they had given us what was essentially a Google Map for how to go from a single fertilized egg all the way over to a human cardiovascular system.
So we shamelessly absconded all of this information and tried to make human cardiovascular development happen in a dish.
It took us about five years, but nowadays, we can get 90 percent of our stem cells to turn into cardiac muscle -- a 900-fold improvement."	So this was quite exciting.	1
2127#218	"You can't look at these tiny connections.
So if we want to make our ability to see the brain more powerful, to get down to the ground truth structure, we're going to need to have even better technologies.
My group, a couple years ago, started thinking: Why don't we do the opposite?"	If it's so darn complicated to zoom in to the brain, why can't we make the brain bigger?	1

And they’d come up with a bunch of interesting solutions -- and actually, quite valid solutions -- to the things that they’d been working on.
And so, some of the things that they figured out, some of these individuals figured out; in one case, a new commercial building and designs for houses that were accepted by clients; a design of a solar space probe experiment; a redesign of the linear electron accelerator; an engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder -- you can tell this is a while ago; the completion of a line of furniture; and even a new conceptual model of the photon."	So it was a pretty successful evening.	1
666#52	"One in seven Africans is a Nigerian, and so everyone wants in to the mobile phone market in Nigeria.
And when MTN came in, they wanted to sell the mobile service like I get in the United States or like people get here in the U.K. or in Europe -- expensive monthly plans, you get a phone, you pay overages, you're killed with fees -- and their plan crashed and burned.
And they went back to the drawing board, and they retooled, and they came up with another plan: We don't sell you the phone, we don't sell you the monthly plan."	We only sell you airtime.	1
1753#128	"But here's the good news.
You are capable of something your nonhuman ancestors weren't capable of.

Using the Internet, we can begin to think collaboratively, we can begin to innovate together.

If we really want to close the gender wage gap, maybe we should start by opening up the payroll.
If this is what total market failure looks like, then openness remains the only way to ensure fairness."	Now, I realize that letting people know what you make might feel uncomfortable, but isn't it less uncomfortable than always wondering if you're being discriminated against, or if your wife or your daughter or your sister is being paid unfairly?	1
438#171	"In the face of such a horrible image -- a wordless image of oblivion that obsesses us -- the only way to cope with it is to put human words to it.

It's here, in red.
The largest individuals of this species, the dreadnoughts of their kind, live just on the north coast of California, where the rain is really intense."

865#100	"Firstborns are also vaccinated more reliably and tend to have more follow-up visits to doctors when they get sick.
And this pattern continues today.
This IQ question is, sadly -- I can say this as a second-born -- a very real thing."	Firstborns have a three-point IQ advantage over second borns and second borns have a 1.5 IQ advantage over later borns, partly because of the exclusive attention firstborns get from mom and dad, and partly because they get a chance to mentor the younger kids.	1

And when it comes to human studies, the scientific gold standard is the randomized clinical trial, or RCT.
The key to RCTs is that the subjects are randomly assigned to their study groups."	They are often blinded to make them more rigorous.	1
1686#131	"We notice of course the prejudices on the other side than in our own bases.

It's a classic gamma retrovirus, but it's totally new; no one's ever seen it before.
Its closest relative is, in fact, from mice, and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus, because it's infecting a species other than mice."	And this is a little phylogenetic tree to see how it's related to other viruses.	1
1176#112	"And that's exactly what the beetles are doing here.
However, there's one more story I'd like to share with you, and that's this particular species.

So we can relax the criterion a bit and say: How many positions do we find where 95 percent of people in Africa have one variant, 95 percent another variant, and the number of that is 12.

MoldeVort starts in one corner of the 5x5 board.

Maybe we need a new story, not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness, but rather a story of victory and triumph, of a valiant battle and, eventually, a graceful retreat, a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe, that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal, and that no wife, no matter how hard she tried, has ever stopped even the bravest, wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go.	1

In fact, the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering."

The masses move -- again, not according to Newton's laws, but because they see this space-time curvature and follow the little curves, just like when our bedmate nestles up to us because of the mattress curvature.
A year later, in 1916, Einstein derived from his theory that gravitational waves existed, and that these waves were produced when masses move, like, for example, when two stars revolve around one another and create folds in space-time which carry energy from the system, and the stars move toward each other."	However, he also estimated that these effects were so minute, that it would never be possible to measure them.	1

But nothing has more perversely impacted Russia's demographic distribution, because the people in the east, who never wanted to be there anyway, have gotten on those trains and roads and gone back to the west."	As a result, in the Russian far east today, which is twice the size of India, you have exactly six million Russians.	1

In the Pantanal, besides the GPS collars, we are using another technique: camera traps.
This camera is equipped with a movement sensor and it photographs animals when they walk in front of it."	So thanks to these amazing devices, we have been able to gather precious information about tapir reproduction and social organization which are very important pieces of the puzzle when you're trying to develop those conservation strategies.	1

So, despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about an object that's supermassive, and I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment, it has no finite size."	So, this is a little tricky.	1

That would be a miracle, and progress is not a miracle but problem-solving.
Problems are inevitable and solutions create new problems which have to be solved in their turn."	The unsolved problems facing the world today are gargantuan, including the risks of climate change and nuclear war, but we must see them as problems to be solved, not apocalypses in waiting, and aggressively pursue solutions like Deep Decarbonization for climate change and Global Zero for nuclear war.	1

So what Yuttho did was that he explained this concept, he had Speck explain it, too, and then he applied it to the city that he was building.

A special protein known as fibrin forms cross-links on the top of the skin, preventing blood from flowing out and bacteria or pathogens from getting in.
After about three hours of this, the skin begins to turn red, signaling the next stage, inflammation."	With bleeding under control and the barrier secured, the body sends special cells to fight any pathogens that may have gotten through.	1

The final thing was writing.
When I got that letter from my son, I began to write a journal about things I had experienced in my childhood and in prison, and what it did is it opened up my mind to the idea of atonement."	Earlier in my incarceration, I had received a letter from one of the relatives of my victim, and in that letter, she told me she forgave me, because she realized I was a young child who had been abused and had been through some hardships and just made a series of poor decisions.	1

""I wanted to know which poet he read, and I landed on a poem called , a toast signifying that got me on the biggest stage a poet could ever be: Broadway, baby.""
