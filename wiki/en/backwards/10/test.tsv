They continue that, ""if"" the nuclear winter models prove to be representative of reality, then far less climatic-cooling would occur, even if firestorm prone areas existed in the target list, as lower fusing heights such as surface bursts would also limit the range of the burning thermal rays due to terrain masking and shadows cast by buildings, while also temporarily lofting far more localized fallout when compared to airburst fuzing – the standard mode of employment against un-hardened targets.
This logic is similarly reflected in the originally classified 1984 ""Interagency Intelligence assessment"", which suggests that targeting planners would simply have to consider target combustibility along with yield, height of burst, timing and other factors to reduce the amount of smoke to safeguard against the potentiality of a nuclear winter."

In his view, this required a move towards a mixed economy that allowed private enterprise but in which all land was owned by the state and in which state industries played a significant part in forestry, mining, and commerce.
He believed that, if post-apartheid South Africa remained capitalist, some black people would join the bourgeoisie but inequality and poverty would remain."	This idea was derided by some of his Marxist contemporaries, but later found parallels in the ideas of the Mexican Zapatistas.	1

Prior to Jerome's Vulgate, all Latin translations of the Old Testament were based on the Septuagint, not the Hebrew.

Another megalith transport theory involves the use of a type of sleigh running on a track greased with animal fat.
Such an experiment with a sleigh carrying a 40-ton slab of stone was successfully conducted near Stonehenge in 1995."

Many studies show that customers are frequently frustrated by a company's inability to meet their relationship expectations, and on the other side, companies do not always know how to translate the data they have gained from CRM software into a feasible action plan.
In 2003, a Gartner report estimated that more than $2 billion had been spent on software that was not being used."	Although focusing on such customers by itself isn't a bad thing, it can leave other customers feeling left out and alienated potentially decreasing profits because of it.	0

Another option is called a rocking stitch, where the quilter has one hand, usually with a finger wearing a thimble, on top of the quilt, while the other hand is located beneath the piece to push the needle back up.
A third option is called ""loading the needle"" and involves doing four or more stitches before pulling the needle through the cloth."	In contrast, the fabric is moved through a home sewing machine.	0
