They continue that, ""if"" the nuclear winter models prove to be representative of reality, then far less climatic-cooling would occur, even if firestorm prone areas existed in the target list, as lower fusing heights such as surface bursts would also limit the range of the burning thermal rays due to terrain masking and shadows cast by buildings, while also temporarily lofting far more localized fallout when compared to airburst fuzing – the standard mode of employment against un-hardened targets.
This logic is similarly reflected in the originally classified 1984 ""Interagency Intelligence assessment"", which suggests that targeting planners would simply have to consider target combustibility along with yield, height of burst, timing and other factors to reduce the amount of smoke to safeguard against the potentiality of a nuclear winter."	"Therefore, as a consequence of attempting to limit the target fire hazard by reducing the range of thermal radiation with fuzing for surface and sub-surface bursts, this will result in a scenario where the far more concentrated, and therefore deadlier, ""local"" fallout that is generated following a surface burst forms, as opposed to the comparatively dilute ""global"" fallout created when nuclear weapons are fuzed in air burst mode."	1

Many sources claim that bald eagles, like all large eagles, cannot normally take flight carrying prey more than half of their own weight unless aided by favorable wind conditions."

More significantly, its curving eastern facade marked the beginnings of the ""Runden Platz"" , a huge circular public space at the point where the North-South Axis and Potsdamer Straße intersected."

Dönitz complimented Italian bravery and daring, but was critical of their training and submarine designs.	1
